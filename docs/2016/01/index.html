Andrew Shitov&#39;s <i><a href="http://deeptext.media/perl6-at-a-glance/">Perl 6 at a Glance</a></i> is already shipping out books. I haven&#39;t had a chance to read it myself, but from the excerpts on the website this looks like a nice survey of the Perl 6 language. It&#39;s not a tutorial book like <i>Learning Perl 6</i>, but I think it&#39;s more than enough to whet your appetite for some of the cool features.

If you are daunted by the reams of pages the printed docs would be, this 130-page book may give you what you need to know with a lot less work.

Now I have rudimentary Perl 6 syntax coloring for BBEdit, my long-preferred editor on the Mac for years. I don&#39;t need anything fancy, so I did the minimum to color the stuff in the files I had open. BBEdit supports <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html">Codeless Language Modules</a> that specify various things about the language, including its file extensions, name, keywords, and so on. It&#39;s something a normal user can put into an XML or JSON file and drop into an <i>Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules</i> directory for immediate use (with an application restart). It&#39;s not as clever as a compiled code module, but good enough for me at the moment. <!--more-->

I&#39;ve put it in the <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/Perl6_BBEdit_CLM">Perl6_BBEdit_CLM</a> project on GitHub for anyone who wants to improve it. For example, I&#39;ve only listed the keywords I was actually using.

You can get syntax coloring for other editors:

Perl 6 has this wonderful thing called <code>MAIN</code> which is a built-in modulino thingy.

In my <a href="http://www.excellentnums.com">excellent number hobby</a> (which I started <a href="http://www.masteringperl.org/tag/excellent-numbers/">writing about in Mastering Perl</a> even after I switched to C), I&#39;ve been converting some bits to Perl 6 just for giggles. There&#39;s a small <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/excellent_numbers/blob/master/lib/CpuCount.pm">Perl 5 module I wrote to get the number of CPUs</a> I rewrote in Perl 6. It&#39;s not sophisticated or surprising. It&#39;s actually quite banal in function; merely dispatch to some method that knows what to do on the platforms I care about. And, be a modulino. <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
module CpuCount {
	sub run () is export {
		say get_cpu_count();
		}

	sub get_cpu_count () is export {
		state $dispatch = {
			freebsd  =&gt; &amp;_freebsd,
			_default =&gt; &amp;_posix,
			};

		my $key = $dispatch.{ $*DISTRO.name }:exists ?? $*DISTRO.name !! &#39;_default&#39;;

		$dispatch.{ $key }.();
		}

	sub _freebsd () { _get_conf( &#39;NPROCESSORS_ONLN&#39; ) }

	sub _posix ()   { _get_conf( &#39;_NPROCESSORS_ONLN&#39; ) }

	sub _get_conf ( $key ) {
		state $command = &#39;/usr/bin/getconf&#39;;

		unless $key ~~ m/ ^^ <[_a..z0..9]>+ $$ / {
			warn &quot;Key $key doesn&#39;t look acceptable&quot;;
			return;
			};
		qq:x{$command $key 2&gt;/dev/null}.chomp;
		}
	}

sub MAIN {
	import CpuCount;
	run;
	}
</[_a..z0..9]></pre>

First, <code>MAIN</code>. Perl 6 calls that if the file is the top-level thingy rather than something that&#39;s loaded by something else. No more <code>caller</code> tricks. It&#39;s even better though. Although I don&#39;t need it here, if I give <code>MAIN</code> a signature, it does some argument handling automatically. And, lexical imports!

Back to the top of the program, I can create a <code>module</code>, similar to Perl 5&#39;s <code>package BLOCK</code> syntax. I really like that. I get export handling without inheritance (that I can see, at least) by marking what is eligible with <code>is export</code>.

Inside <code>get_cpu_count</code>, I use the <code>$*DISTRO</code> special variable to find out what system I&#39;m on. That&#39;s an object with various parts I can access.

In the dispatch table, I get a reference to a subroutine by using the <code>&amp;</code> in front of it. That messed me up for a bit, but I think I like that.

In <code>_get_conf</code>, I have a regex. That&#39;s changed quite a bit with double typing. The <code>^^</code> and <code>$$</code> are anchors, whitespace is insignificant by default, and character classes are much fancier. Those are put in <code> &lt;[ ... ]&gt; </code> because you can do set operations on the things in the square brackets. Very fancy, but there&#39;s more typing. I also have to use <code>..</code> to make a range of characters. Disk drives are cheap, so let&#39;s use up those bytes!

I love string objects. I call the external command and can <code>chomp</code> it right away. And, <code>chomp</code> returns the modified string like God always wanted.

Topaz, which was almost the next version of Perl in 2000, is still in Sourceforge. Chip Salzenberg had a hunch that rewriting Perl&#39;s guts in C++ would be the thing to solve its maintenance issues. He codenamed his project <a href="http://topaz.sourceforge.net">Topaz</a> and went to work. <!--more-->

He didn&#39;t get it working though, and Chip&#39;s the sort of guy that can get anything working. He took C++ to its limits. At the 1999 OSCON, he explained what he wanted to do and why he chose C++ in his talk <a href="//www.perl.com/pub/1999/09/topaz.html">Topaz: Perl for the 22nd Century</a>. It&#39;s old enough that there&#39;s a RealAudio version of the talk. Heck, the Topaz repo uses CVS. I tried compiling CVS but it doesn&#39;t like my <code>getline</code> (and I didn&#39;t try that hard).

A year later he had given up, for solid technical reasons, but also because the community pushed all in for Perl 6.  I recall a talk where Chip discussed very technical C++ things he discovered, but it seems to have disappeared from the world. We also might have been sitting around a table in the hallway listening to him talk about it too. For what it&#39;s worth, Simon Cozens tried a similar thing with <a href="//www.perl.com/pub/2000/09/sapphire.html">Sapphire</a> (and there&#39;s <a href="http://perl11.org">Perl 11</a> and <a href="http://rperl.org">RPerl</a> and ...).

Much of the discussion around that time was about which language the next perl sources would use. The then current Perl 5 sources were in C and had macros on top of macros (on top of macros) as it bent over backward to not conflict with other C code it might be embedded next to. Today we have <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/DBI">DBI</a> as a generic database interface, but back in the day there were things like <b>oraperl</b>, an Oracle client with Perl embedded in it (or Perl with an Oracle client embedded in it).

Other options were briefly considered, but a crazy idea stuck. Perl 6 would be written in Perl 6. That sounds a little weird, but if you unwind it a bit it works. 

There&#39;s <a href="//github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP</a>, or &quot;Not Quite Perl 6&quot; which serves as a basic layer between a virtual machine and Perl 6. From that, NQP looks quite a bit like Perl 6 and can bootstrap Perl 6. As long as NQP can translate its part to the layer under it, Perl 6 can go anywhere NQP can go. That might be Parrot, a JVM, or <a href="//www.moarvm.org">MOAR</a> (MetaModel on a Runtime).
