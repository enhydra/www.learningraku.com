Topaz, which was almost the next version of Perl in 2000, is still in Sourceforge. Chip Salzenberg had a hunch that rewriting Perl's guts in C++ would be the thing to solve its maintenance issues. He codenamed his project <a href="http://topaz.sourceforge.net">Topaz</a> and went to work. <!--more-->

He didn't get it working though, and Chip's the sort of guy that can get anything working. He took C++ to its limits. At the 1999 OSCON, he explained what he wanted to do and why he chose C++ in his talk <a href="//www.perl.com/pub/1999/09/topaz.html">Topaz: Perl for the 22nd Century</A>. It's old enough that there's a RealAudio version of the talk. Heck, the Topaz repo uses CVS. I tried compiling CVS but it doesn't like my <code>getline</code> (and I didn't try that hard).

A year later he had given up, for solid technical reasons, but also because the community pushed all in for Perl 6.  I recall a talk where Chip discussed very technical C++ things he discovered, but it seems to have disappeared from the world. We also might have been sitting around a table in the hallway listening to him talk about it too. For what it's worth, Simon Cozens tried a similar thing with <a href="//www.perl.com/pub/2000/09/sapphire.html">Sapphire</a> (and there's <a href="http://perl11.org">Perl 11</a> and <a href="http://rperl.org">RPerl</a> and ...).

Much of the discussion around that time was about which language the next perl sources would use. The then current Perl 5 sources were in C and had macros on top of macros (on top of macros) as it bent over backward to not conflict with other C code it might be embedded next to. Today we have <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/DBI">DBI</a> as a generic database interface, but back in the day there were things like <b>oraperl</b>, an Oracle client with Perl embedded in it (or Perl with an Oracle client embedded in it).

Other options were briefly considered, but a crazy idea stuck. Perl 6 would be written in Perl 6. That sounds a little weird, but if you unwind it a bit it works. 

There's <a href="//github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP</a>, or "Not Quite Perl 6" which serves as a basic layer between a virtual machine and Perl 6. From that, NQP looks quite a bit like Perl 6 and can bootstrap Perl 6. As long as NQP can translate its part to the layer under it, Perl 6 can go anywhere NQP can go. That might be Parrot, a JVM, or <A href="//www.moarvm.org">MOAR</a> (MetaModel on a Runtime).
