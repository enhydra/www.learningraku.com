Perl 6 has a REPL. That's a tiny, language-specific shell that <b>R</b>eads a line, <b>E</b>valuates it, <b>P</b>rints the result, and <b>L</b>oops to do it again. It can remember the previous results in the same session.

Let's start with something simple. Run the <i>perl6</i> command with no arguments and wait for the prompt: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type 'exit' or '^D'
>
</pre>

I can try the usual "Hello World" program:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
</pre>

I can try it with <code>say</code>, which outputs the string with a newline on the end. That's how I would need to output it inside a program; inside the REPL, that doesn't look different than
what I already did:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> say 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
</pre>

In Perl 6 land, a string is an object, so I can call methods on the string. Perl 6 uses the dot as the method call operator:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.say
Hello World!
</pre>

What else can I do with <code'"Hello World!'</code>? Perl 6 values are themselves objects. The <code>WHAT</code> "meta" method knows what thingys are:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.WHAT
(Str)
</pre>

The <code>(Str)</code> is the name of the class in parentheses. I don't need to know the type of thing it is to figure out what I can do. Or, read another way, I don't need to look at the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str">docs for Str</a> to see what methods I can call. The <code>.^methods</code> method (ahem) tells me what the object can respond to:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods
(BUILD Int Num chomp pred succ simplematch match ords samecase
samemark samespace word-by-word trim-leading trim-trailing trim
encode NFC NFD NFKC NFKD wordcase trans indent codes chars uc lc tc
fc tclc flip ord WHY WHICH Bool Str Stringy DUMP ACCEPTS chop
starts-with ends-with substr-eq contains indices index rindex Numeric
gist perl comb subst-mutate subst lines split words)
</pre>

That <code>.^methods</code> looks weird, but it's really just a shortcut for <code>.HOW.methods</code>. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Metamodel$COLON$COLONClassHOW"><b>H</b>igher <b>O</b>rder <b>W</b>orkings</a> class has many ways to <i>introspect</i> a thingy. This is an amazing boon to learning the language since you can, at least partly, discover things about the objects from inside the language. All your Ruby friends will say "Welcome to 1995!".

Notice that <code>say</code> is not in the list. By default, <code>.^methods</code> doesn't show methods from certain base classes. I can ask for different slices of that list by adding the <code>:all</code> adverb:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all)
(BUILD Int Num chomp pred succ simplematch match ords samecase
samemark samespace word-by-word trim-leading trim-trailing trim encode
NFC NFD NFKC NFKD wordcase trans indent codes chars uc lc tc fc tclc
flip ord WHY WHICH Bool Str Stringy DUMP ACCEPTS chop starts-with
ends-with substr-eq contains indices index rindex Numeric gist perl
comb subst-mutate subst lines split words trans fmt comb acosech cotan
sin fc contains EVAL cosec atan2 abs ord trim-trailing ords acotan
asec ceiling unpolar acosec acos indices log10 exp match subst chrs
acosh truncate acotanh Num path floor UInt words flip asin codes
univals asech chomp split cotanh ...)
</pre>

That's right, I said adverb. Things that start with a colon are modifiers for an action. You can worry about those later. In this case, <code>:all</code> modifies how <code>.^methods</code> responds.

Still, I don't see <code>say</code> in that list, which is truncated with <code>...</code>. Perl 6 displays the result as a "gist", or, the general idea of the result in a human-readable form. It's the same thing as this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all).gist
</pre>

This gist an amazing feature. I've wished that <a href="">Data::Dumper</a> was built into Perl 5 so many times. Now it's available to most objects automatically, but it is not going to overload you with output. I'll have to do a bit of work on my own for that.

If that's too high-level for you, the <code>perl</code> method is closer to the internal representation. You can run this yourself if you'd like to see the very long and complicated output that's pretty useless to all but 11 people in the world:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all).perl
</pre>

But, I want to find that <code>say</code> method. What do I get back from <code>^methods()</code>? I call <code>WHAT</code> again and see that I get a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/List">List</a> object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all).WHAT
(List)
</pre>

That's a list, but what's in the list? I can call <code>map</code> on the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/List">List</a>. I cheat a bit here because I know that there should be something like <code>map</code> and I looked at the documentation. I'd much rather discover that through exploration, but that's how it is at the moment:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all).map( {.WHAT.gist} ).unique
((Submethod) (Method) (Method+{Callable[Int:D]}) (Method+{&lt;anon|140546676469920>}))
</pre>


The <code>map</code> gets each item in the list and passes it to the block argument. Perl 6 does some impressive stuff with blocks, but for now think of it as an inline subroutine. Inside this <code>map</code>, I call <code>.WHAT.gist</code>. What's up with the leading dot?

Perl 6 has a default variable, which it calls the <i>topic</i>. If there's no object in front of the method-calling dot, it uses that topic.

Once I've constructed that list I call <code>unique</code> to make a list of just the types it saw. Each thing is a some sort of <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Method">Method</A>.

A <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Method">Method</A> knows its name (if it has one). This in itself is quite interesting. If I call <code>can</code> on an object and that object can respond to a method of that name, it gives me back a list of methods? (A list? Yep! Because Perl 6 has multi dispatch based on the arguments I pass!). Even though I have a list of one item, I only want to first item. I store that in <code>$method</code> (which I must declare before use):

<pre class="brush:plain">
> my $method = 'Hello World!'.can( 'say' ).first
say
</pre>


The REPL remembers what I stored in that variable. It's a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Method">Method</A> and I can ask it its name. I can also use the variable in place of the literal method name to operate on my string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> $method.name
say
> 'Hello World!'.$method
Hello World!
</pre>

It's a bit easier to see if I use a different method, such as <code>uc</code> to uppercase

<pre class="brush:plain">
> my $method = 'Hello World!'.can( 'uc' ).first
uc
> 'Hello World!'.$method
HELLO WORLD!
</pre>

This is very exciting! It might not seem like much, but when these things are objects that know things about themselves, a big world of  programming opens up.

But, I started off looking for <code>say</code> but I haven't found it yet.

I can make a new list of just the names by calling <code>map</code> and <code>sort</code> that. When I give only one argument to the block in <code>sort</code>, it uses that result to compare elements. It also remembers that value so it does not calculate it again (so, no Schwartzian Transform needed!):

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all).map( { .name } ).sort( { .lc } ).unique.join( "\n" )
</pre>

This creates a really long string, but it's all the methods available on <code>"Hello World"</code>. I can make a shorter list with <code>grep</code> by looking for things that have <code>sa</code> at the start of the string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> 'Hello World!'.^methods(:all).map( {.name} ).grep( { /^^ sa/ } ).join( "\n" )
samecase
samemark
samespace
samecase
say
</pre>

And, I've found <code>say</code>! It took me a bit, but I was able to find out quite a bit starting with just the object.

I can define my own class with some attributes. Here's a <code>Butterfly</code> class that has a name and a type attribute. I
can create an object in that class, then look at the

<pre class="brush:plain">
> class Butterfly { has Str $.name; has Str $.type; }
(Butterfly)
> my $camelia = Butterfly.new( name => 'Camelia', type => 'Monarch' );
Butterfly.new(name => "Camelia", type => "Monarch")
> $camelia.WHAT
(Butterfly)
> $camelia.^attributes
(Str $!name Str $!type)
</pre>

I could keep going like this to try bits of Perl 6. I don't have to write programs for the very short experiements. Personally, I like to keep the experiments in files because I keep changing things. It's better than retyping.
