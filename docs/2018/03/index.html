My <a href="https://www.metacpan.org/module/Tie::Cycle">Tie::Cycle</a> Perl 5 module is almost trivial but it solved a customer problem a long, long time ago. It&#39;s makes a list that looks like a scalar. Every time you access the scalar you get the next value in the list (wrapping around at the end).

How would I do the same thing in Perl 6? I started thinking about a way to make a sequence whose elements were always <code>True</code>, infinitely and forever. I fell back on the idea of cycling through a list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $colors := make-cycle( &lt;red green blue&gt; );

for $colors {
	put $_;
	last if $++ &gt; 5;
	}

sub make-cycle ( *@a --&gt; Seq ) {
	{ @a[ $++ % * ] } ... Inf
	}
</pre>

It loops through all of the colors:

<pre class="brush:plain">
red
green
blue
red
green
blue
red
</pre>

I could have done the same thing with other lists that would cycle forever. Even the trivial list of one item might be useful. This is what I wanted when I started playing with this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $false       := make-cycle( False );
my $true        := make-cycle( True  );
my $true-false  := make-cycle( True, False );
my $false-true  := make-cycle( False, True );
</pre>

The <code>...</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_...">sequence operator</a>. You can use some code to decide what comes next. That includes deciding what comes first. I want to grab the next element of the array. That&#39;s easy. Keep a cursor of the index and add to each each time I grab to something. When it gets too big reset it to the beginning.

Perl 6 has nice syntax for this. All that is in <code>$++ % *</code> that I use for the index in <code>@a[  ]</code>. I need a variable to act as the cursor. I don&#39;t need it anywhere else than inside the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#postcircumfix_[_]">array indexing operator</a>.

The <code>$</code> by itself is an anonymous scalar variable that allows you to skip the declaration; the variable shows up exactly once because that&#39;s how many times I need it. The <code>++</code> is the auto-increment operator to move the cursor along.

The value in <code>$</code> eventually passes the last index of the list. The modulus operator <code>%</code> brings it back in that range. For a list of 5 items, the first item is list is at indices 0, 5, 10, and so on. Those are all effectively 0 modulo the number elements.

The <code>*</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> star. What that does depends on where it shows up. In the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#postcircumfix_[_]">array indexing operator</a> it&#39;s the number of elements (not the last index) in the thingy. That&#39;s the same number I need for the modulus.

All together that&#39;s the cryptic <code>$++ % *</code>. It&#39;s a bit tricky to read but I typically don&#39;t start writing code like that unless I&#39;ve done it before. I do it the long way.

I don&#39;t even need the <code>make-cycle</code> factory (although it&#39;s convenient to forget how this works). I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want this all over my code even if I can do it:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $seq := { ( &lt;red green blue&gt; )[ $++ % * ] } ... Inf;
</pre>

Even then, <code>Seq.from-loop</code> already does most of the work. I don&#39;t need to use <code>...</code> because this keeps going by always calling the block of code to get the next value:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $seq := Seq.from-loop: { ( &lt;red green blue&gt; )[ $++ % *] };
</pre>

It could be a module but this isn&#39;t node.

AppVeyor now <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/getting-started-with-appveyor-for-linux/">supports Ubuntu</a> along with Windows. I&#39;ve updated my <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test">Perl 6 AppVeyor config example</a> to include that. I created a <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">chocolatey package for Rakudo Star</a> to make it easier to test on AppVeyor. I think there are some Rakudo Star packages for linux in the future and that will make the linux side even easier and faster. At the moment it takes about 20 minutes to build before you get to the tests.

I wanted to make a method that took an integer or a string that looked like an integer. I thought a coercion type would work nicely for that. The <code>Int</code> is the target type and <code>Str</code> is the type it will accept then coerce:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub something ( Int:D(Str:D) $n ) { ... }

something( 37 );
something( &quot;137&quot; );
something( &quot;Hello&quot; ); # I want this to fail
something( 1.5 );     # I want this to fail too
</pre>

That didn&#39;t quite work out. If I pass it a <code>Str</code> it calls <code>.Int</code>. A string like <code>&quot;1.5&quot;</code> converts just fine because the <code>.Int</code> not only changes types but can change the data. We are used to <code>int()</code> as a way to make floating point numbers into whole numbers. So, <code>.Int</code> has two jobs: managing types and managing values. I don&#39;t like that and don&#39;t think that 3.14 is 3. I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/49262872/2766176">asked about it on StackOverflow</a> and got some interesting answers. Brad Gilbert shows <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49280457/2766176">the long hard way</a> which is close to what I was already doing but there&#39;s no need for the coercion type then. I was a little disappointed.

Then I wondered what would happen if a <code>.Int</code> method did not return the right sort of type. I didn&#39;t expect this to run without an error (I originally typed &quot;expect this to work&quot;!) but it does. I made an <code>.Int</code> that returned a <code>Str</code>. That&#39;s silly but I can imagine myself making stupid error like this and typing should show my stupidity:

<pre class="brush:plain">
class Foo {
    method Int ( --&gt; Str:D ) { &#39;Hello&#39; }
    }

put try-it( Foo.new );

sub try-it ( Int:D() $n ) { &quot;Got 「$n」 of type 「{$n.^name}」&quot; }
</pre>

Although the subroutine signature demanded an <code>Int</code> it accepted something that claimed to be able to convert but actually didn&#39;t. The <code>.Int</code> method is the right thing to call but there was nothing to check that it did the right thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Got 「Hello」 of type 「Str」
</pre>

I would have expected the runtime constraint to check the ultimate value against the type and this would have failed. But it doesn&#39;t check that the value ends up the correct type. Assigning to a value with a type limitation works though:

<pre class="brush:plain">
class Foo {
	method Int { &quot;Hello&quot; }
	}

my Str $m = Foo.Int;  # works
my Int $n = Foo.Int;  # this fails as expected
</pre>

I filed <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132980">RT 132980</a> which led to some <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#Coercion_Type">clarifications in the documentation</a> but also a note that it&#39;s on the back burner for a fix because the proper type check leads to a slowdown (even if you don&#39;t use it, I take it). The motto of Rakudo had been <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq#Is_Perl_6_fast_enough_for_me?">&quot;make it work right then make it work fast&quot;</a>, but sometimes there are other trade-offs that are more important.

I&#39;ve been fooling around with <a href="/2018/03/15/use-pre-built-rakudo-packages-on-travis-ci/">pre-built Rakudo packages on Travis CI</a> so I figured that I should do the same on AppVeyor. Last night I had a <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/briandfoy/venturi/build/1.0.12/job/ahmktqs4ynu5u7x2">Ubuntu build that ran out of memory</a> before it could finish compiling Rakudo and it gave up. <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/getting-started-with-appveyor-for-linux/">AppVeyor is rolling out Linux support</a> and I suspect their initial machines are underpowered (especially the ones I get for free—completely reasonable) but I haven&#39;t investigated it. It&#39;s certainly easier than the Pugs installations which could take days although much of that was just GHC. <!--more-->

The Windows side is easy because I use the <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">rakudo-star chocolatey package</a>.

This configuration is mostly the same as <a href="/2018/03/15/use-pre-built-rakudo-packages-on-travis-ci/">what I am doing on Travis</a> but translated to a configuration that&#39;s handling Windows and Linux at the same time. Lines starting with <code>sh:</code> are run on Linux only; lines with no prefix are run on both systems.

I changed my Perl 6 Travis setup so I&#39;m not using the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/community-supported-languages/">community supported</a> Perl 6. That one builds rakudo and sometimes it exhausts the memory. Even if it didn&#39;t do that it takes awhile to get to the things I want to test. My new configuration takes the run time from about 7 to under 2 minutes. <!--more-->

<a href="https://github.com/nxadm">Claudio Ramirez</a> provides some <a href="https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg">pre-built Rakudo packages for Linux</a>. I can install those instead of building Rakudo. To do that I can&#39;t declare a language (or can declare some language that in the base image). Declaring  &quot;perl6&quot; builds rakudo—maybe someone will change the community edition to use the pre-built package.

I still have a problem with the URL to get the pre-built package. There is a URL to get the latest package by <a href="https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/lib.js">redirecting through some javascript</a>. It&#39;s not something that needs to happen in Javascript since the answers don&#39;t change and we could have a static page. That&#39;s maybe something I can work on later—or maybe you can. Put the direct links in the README and regenerate that when the packages change (monthly).

This is working nicely so far and I can improve on it later:
