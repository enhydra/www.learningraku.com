<div class="excerpt">


<i>Learning Perl 6</i> won&#39;t be renamed <i>Learning Raku</i> until at soonest the next major release cycle (maybe in a couple of years), although the latest cover for the reprint says &quot;Covers Raku&quot; in the upper right banner. However, if you have a digital version, you might like to replace your digital cover with this one I mocked up and is completely unofficial and unauthorized (<a href="/images/cover-large-raku.png">PNG</a>, <a href="/images/cover-large-raku.pdf">PDF</a>):

<h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2020/03/17/reducing-comparison-operators/">Reducing comparison operators</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">


Brad Gilbert say my Effective Perl post about script runs (a stable feature in v5.32) and <a href="  https://twitter.com/b2gills/status/1239987592197738506">offered this Raku version on Twitter</a>:
<pre class="brush:plain"># Perl 5:  /(*script_run:(\d+))/
/ \d+  &lt;?{ [eq] $/.Str.uniprops(&#39;script&#39;) }&gt; /
</pre>
Bascially, it matches <code>\d+</code> then immediately uses an assertion that looks that the thing it just matched, <code>$/</code>, has characters with all the same Unicode properties.

He then defines a new <code>regex</code> to wrap it all up:
<pre class="brush:plain">my regex script-run ($r) {
  $r
  &lt;?{ [eq] $/.Str.uniprops(&#39;script&#39;) }&gt;
}

/ &lt;script-run( /\d+/ )&gt; /
</pre>
That&#39;s fine. The Raku grammars are really cool and amazingly flexible and is a language within the language (well, &quot;slang&quot;).

The thing I find delightful about this Brad&#39;s use of the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Reduction_operators">reduction operator</a>, <code>[...]</code> with a comparison operator. So, I wrote this little program in Raku (<a href="https://repl.it/repls/CreepyGlossyTriangles">in repl.it</a>):
<pre class="brush:plain">my $n = 200.rand.Int;

if [&lt;] 37, $n, 137 {
    say &quot;$n is between 37 and 137&quot;;
    }
else {
    say &quot;$n is not between 37 and 137&quot;;
    }
</pre>
This works, and had I thought about it I might have expected it to work. Many (not all) of the math operators don&#39;t care about the order of operations, so <code>2 + 3 + 5</code> is <code>(2 + 3) + 5</code> is <code>2 + (3 + 5)</code>. Some operations do care, like exponentiation: <code>4**3**2</code> is <code>4**(3**2)</code> and is not <code>(4**3)**2</code>. The reduction operator isn&#39;t what you might expect from most examples; it doesn&#39;t just run the operation with the first two elements and replace them with a single value. It knows what operations to do first.

But, what&#39;s the result of a comparison operator? What does the reduction operator do then?

Raku has <a href="/2017/05/21/dont-use-in-programming/">&quot;chained&quot; comparisons</a>, but what you write is not what Raku is actually doing (like any good higher-level language):
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">37 &lt; $n &lt; 137
</pre>
which is the same as doing each comparison on its own and logically combining the results:
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">37 &lt; $n and $n &lt; 137
</pre>
Another way to write this is with the reduction operator:
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[&lt;] 37, $n, 137
</pre>
And it all works out. No loops and short.

<h2 class="post_title"><a href="/2019/12/01/long-live-raku/">Long Live Raku</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">


In October 2019, <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tpf-response-raku-rename">Perl 6 changed its name to Raku</a>. I think it&#39;s a good move to let the language stand on its own two feet.

I&#39;ve updated the older domains for this blog to permanently redirect to the new <i>www.learningraku.com</i>. I&#39;d already changed the Twitter account to <i><a href="https://twitter.com/LearningRaku">@LearningRaku</a></i>. If you run into something that doesn&#39;t work, let me know.

I&#39;m also exploring how I can change the name of the printed and e-books. Since the book is created by print-on-demand, that might not be too hard. It could take some time since I&#39;d also take the chance to update the book for current Raku behavior.

Various parts of the Raku community will change their names, labels, and references in the coming weeks as people have time to deal with the huge effort. <a href="https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3046">You might even be able to help</a>.

Learning Perl 6 has its first translation. I know that the translators worked hard on it because I answered many questions for them. It is on sale now at <a href="https://www.kingstone.com.tw/new/basic/2014713579683">KingStone</a> and <a href="https://www.tenlong.com.tw/products/9789865021382">Ten Long</a> and probably other places.

<div class="excerpt">


Rakudo Star 2018.10 is now in Chocolatey as the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/rakudostar">rakudostar</a> package. There&#39;s something to note here: Steve Mynott has he&#39;s not going to prepare another Rakudo Star release. That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t going to be more releasesâjust that someone else needs to prepare them.

You might have expected this since the Rakudo Star releases have been gradually missing their release months and that the last two were backdated. That&#39;s not a big deal, but it shows that it&#39;s not trivial to put out these releases. The Rakudo compiler has monthly releases.

Maybe you can be the person who makes this easier!
