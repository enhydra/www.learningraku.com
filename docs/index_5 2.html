While testing <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find">a module</a> I wanted to check that a deprecation warning shows up. <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/warn">Warnings are a special sort of exception</a> that you can catch in a <code>CONTROL</code> block. <!--more-->

</div>
</div>

In my test file I add a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/phasers#CONTROL">CONTROL phaser</a>. This catches the action of block exiting things including <code>return</code>, <code>fail</code>, <code>redo</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>take</code>, and in this case, <code>warn</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
{ # with forced find to Not work recursive
CONTROL {
	my $label = &#39;:recursive warns about deprecation&#39;;
	when CX::Warn { like $_.message, /deprecated/, $label; }
	default       { fail( $label ); }
	}
my $res = find(:dir&lt;t/dir1&gt;, :name&lt;file.bar&gt;, recursive =&gt; False);
is $res.elems, 1, &#39;name with a string&#39;;
}
</pre>

You won&#39;t catch these in a normal <code>CATCH</code> block:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub foow { warn &quot;This is a warning&quot; }
sub food { die  &quot;This is a death&quot; }

{
CONTROL {
	when CX::Warn { put &quot;Caught warning in CONTROL&quot; }
	}
foow();
}


try {
CATCH {
	when CX::Warn  { put &quot;Caught warning in CATCH&quot; }
	when  X::AdHoc { put &quot;Caught death in CATCH&quot; }
	default { put &quot;Caught {$_.^name} with {$_.message}&quot; }
	}
foow();
food();
}
</pre>

The output shows that the <code>CONTROL</code> caught the warning from the first call but the <code>CATCH</code> let it pass through in the second:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Caught warning in CONTROL
Caught death in CATCH
This is a warning
  in sub foow at /Users/brian/Desktop/test.p6 line 5
</pre>

Turning numbers into strings can be a big waste of time and money.  Paul Khuong wrote about this in <a href="//www.pvk.ca/Blog/2017/12/22/appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/">How to Print Integers Really Fast (With Open Source AppNexus Code!)</a>. If you&#39;ve bought into the JSON mania you&#39;re probably serializing numbers as strings quite a bit without even thinking about it. Much of his discussion is special to C or C++ where you (think) you directly control the hardware. Since this is also a typical interview problem I thought I&#39;d work on it in Perl 6 with a few extras. <!--more-->

The solutions I found convert everything to decimal numbers. There are probably some hexadecimal converters out there. That&#39;s not so interesting. How about a converter for arbitrary bases with arbitrary digits? And, I can&#39;t use any of the builtin stuff to make this work (and so far I haven&#39;t peeked to see how Rakudo does it).

The solution is to decompose a number into parts and convert that  partto a string with a lookup table. Put together all your string parts to get the full number. Optimizing that lookup table is most of the problem but I don&#39;t worry about that right away.

I create a factory that takes a single string where each character represents a digit; the number of digits is the base. I don&#39;t care which characters are in the string. Maybe they aren&#39;t in order of their codepoints, or they are repeated, or some other weird thing. Specify a stupid string and get stupid number serializations. If I don&#39;t specify a string I&#39;ll default to the decimal digits. From that I get the base that I&#39;ll use to decompose the number and I&#39;ll break up the string into characters in an array so I can use the numeric value as the index to map it onto its string value. I&#39;ll collect the string values then join them:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub int-to-str-factory (
		Str:D $digit-str = &#39;0123456789&#39;
		--&gt; Callable:D ) {
	my Int:D $base  = $digit-str.chars;
	my Str:D @table = $digit-str.comb;

	sub ( Int:D $i is copy where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Str:D ) {
		my Str:D @temp = ();

		return @table.[0] if $i == 0;

		while $i &gt; 0 {
			my Int:D $digit = $i % $base;
			$i div= $base;
			@temp.unshift: @table.[ $digit ];
			}

		@temp.join: &#39;&#39;;
		}
	}
</pre>

This doesn&#39;t convert numbers to strings. It creates code that converts numbers to strings and returns that anonymous subroutine. That&#39;s what a factory does. I&#39;ve also limited this to zero and positive integers but handling sign is not a big deal if I need it.

The <code>div</code> operator for integer division is quite a handy complement to the <code>%</code> modulus to get the remainder. I thought briefly about defining my own operator to return the remainder and reduce the starting number in one step, but maybe I&#39;ll come back to that in some other post.

If I were doing this in C++ I&#39;d care about that because the bits in physical storage probably care about them. The original posts were using binary-coded decimal that used four bits per digit. Add the same nybble to each of those and you get the ASCII character for that digit. Clever. Since Perl 6 doesn&#39;t let me look at the physical representation I can skip that part of the problem (although I could connect to external libraries). That also means that I don&#39;t have to allocate any memory for my final string. I don&#39;t get to make those choices although the C++ program thinks hard about that.

Now I can create something to turn numbers into decimal strings:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $decimal-stringifier = int-to-str-factory();
put $decimal-stringifier.( 0xDEADBEEF );
</pre>

Remember that my use of a literal hexadecimal number there is a red herring. The parser converts that into an internal integer and doesn&#39;t care how it started. I&#39;m converting internal numbers to strings.

So let&#39;s make some fancy strings. I&#39;ll make a hash with labels for the representation as keys and their code as the value (<a href="//gist.github.com/briandfoy/b648b4c88580d18ecc789b3e3e966c61">it&#39;s all in a gist</a>), but that might diverge from the code in this article):

<pre class="brush:plain">
#`(
Create a bunch of anonymous subroutines to create different representations of an integer. The label is the key of the 
hash and the sub is the value.
)
my %representations = map { $_.[0] =&gt; int-to-str-factory( $_.[1] ) }, (
	( &#39;Decimal&#39;,&#39;0123456789&#39; ),
	( &#39;Binary&#39;, &#39;üëéüëç&#39; ),
	( &#39;Base3&#39;, &#39;012&#39; ),
	( &#39;Octal&#39;, &#39;01234567&#39; ),
	( &#39;Hex&#39;, &#39;0123456789abcdef&#39; ),
	( &#39;Base36&#39;, &#39;0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#39; ),
	( &#39;Braille&#39;, &#39;‚†Å‚†É‚†â‚†ô‚†ë‚†ã‚†õ‚†ì‚†ä‚†ö&#39; ),
	( &#39;Arabic&#39;, @(
		&#39;ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO&#39;.parse-names
				..
		&#39;ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT NINE&#39;.parse-names
		).join: &#39;&#39; ),
	);


sub MAIN ( Int:D $n = 100_000_000.rand.Int ) {
	put &quot;number is $n&quot;;

	for %representations.kv -&gt; $label, $sub {
		put &quot;$label: &quot;, $sub.( $n );
		}
	}
</pre>

Here&#39;s a run of that:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 int-to-str.pl 137
number is 137
Base36: 3t
Binary: üëçüëéüëéüëéüëçüëéüëéüëç
Base3: 1202
Decimal: 137
Octal: 211
Arabic: Ÿ°Ÿ£Ÿß
Braille: ‚†É‚†ô‚†ì
Hex: 89
</pre>

As I mentioned earlier I don&#39;t get to think as hard in Perl 6 as C++. I&#39;m much farther away from the iron so choosing registers wisely and other things that hardware cares about. Andrei Alexandrescu writes about this in <a href="//www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/three-optimization-tips-for-c/10151361643253920">Three Optimization Tips for C++</a> where he solves the same problem.

Part of these C++ solutions involve decomposing the number into larger chunks (powers of the base) and translating chunks with a longer lookup table. In C++ they wanted to minimize division operations, which probably makes less sense in a much higher level language like Perl 6. Instead of decomposing 8936 into 8, 9, 3, 6 I can decompose it into 89 and 36 and translate those numbers directly without more math. There&#39;s a trick; if I break up the number 1307 into 13 and 07, I can&#39;t translate 07 to 7. That zero needs to stay there.

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub int-to-str-factory (
		Str:D $digit-str = &#39;0123456789&#39;
		--&gt; Callable:D ) {
	my Int:D $base   = $digit-str.chars;
	my Int:D $base2  = $base ** 2;

	# expand lookup to all one digit strings. These don&#39;t
	# have leading zeros
	my Str:D @digits = $digit-str.comb;

	# expand lookup to all two digit strings
	# leading zeros matter!
	my Str:D @digits2 = @digits X~ @digits;

	sub ( Int:D $i is copy where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Str:D ) {
		my Str:D @temp = ();

		return @digits.[0] if $i == 0;

		while $i &gt; 0 {
			if $i &gt;= $base2 {
				my Int:D $digit = $i % $base2;
				@temp.unshift: @digits2.[ $digit ];
				$i div= $base2
				}
			else {
				my Int:D $digit = $i % $base;
				@temp.unshift: @digits.[ $digit ];
				$i div= $base
				}
			}

		return @temp.join: &#39;&#39;;
		}
	}
</pre>

How big that lookup table is depends on many things including the typical size of your numbers. A smaller table requires you to do more divisions but a larger table might involve more searching. I used an array but I could have used a hash. No optimization is probably best for any situation. You have to know something about your numbers. If you always have numbers that take up all 256 bits (a SHA perhaps) you have a different optimization than numbers mostly under 100.

But now here&#39;s another thing I can do. I can break up a really big number into much larger chunks and provide those smaller numbers as a sequence. I then format those separately (perhaps in parallel) by calling <code>.hyper</code> on that sequence. The <code>.hyper</code> allows parallelism (where available) and keeps everything in order (unlike <code>.race</code> which doesn&#39;t). I re√§ssemble the chunks at the end.

The <code>big-chunks-sequence</code> sequences makes the smaller numbers and I&#39;ve moved the factories into a module to get them out of the way (<a href="//gist.github.com/briandfoy/bc5b47efb30af6d84135a91bd5c44b2e">gist</a>).

<pre class="brush:plain">

I implemented Heap&#39;s algorithm, which generates all permutations of a list, in Perl 6. It&#39;s the end of the year and I&#39;m cleaning out all the things I marked to read later. Sometimes I&#39;ll take something simple, such as a famous algorithm, and try to do it on my own. It&#39;s good practice for language skills but it&#39;s also a good education on languages. <!--more-->

I was reading David M.Bradford&#39;s <a href="http://tinypig2.blogspot.co.za/2016/12/heaps-algorithm-and-generating-perl.html">Heap&#39;s Algorithm and Generating Perl Code From Pseudocode</a>, which referenced the Wikipedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap&#39;s_algorithm">Heap&#39;s Algorithm</a>.

There&#39;s already a method that does this, but I&#39;m not going to let that stand in my way:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my @array = &lt;a b c&gt;
[a b c]
&gt; @array.permutations
((a b c) (a c b) (b a c) (b c a) (c a b) (c b a))
</pre>

The structure of my solution is mostly the same (<i>mutatis mutandi</i>) that I&#39;d read on either of those pages:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @array = &lt;a b c&gt;;

for heaps-algorithm( @array, ) -&gt; $permutation {
	put $permutation;
	}

sub heaps-algorithm ( *@array ) {
	state $i = 0;
	state @permutations = [ @array.clone, ];
	state @A = |@permutations.[0].clone;
	state @c = (0) xx @A.elems;

	loop {
		if @c[$i] &lt; $i {
			my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
			@A[$swap-index, $i] = @A[$i, $swap-index];
			@permutations.push: @A.clone;
			@c[$i]++;
			$i = 0;
			}
		else {
			@c[$i] = 0;
			$i++;
			}
		
		last unless $i &lt; @array.elems;
		}

	return @permutations;
	}
</pre>

There are a few interesting bits of Perl 6 syntax. It&#39;s the end of the year and I have many other things to use or lose so I&#39;ll merely point out a few things:

<h3>The single argument rule</h3>

I wanted to build up an array of permutations. For the first item I store the original array. I have a significant trailing comma there:

<pre class="brush:plain">
	state @permutations = [ @array.clone, ];
</pre>

If I only use a single array argument (the single argument), the array is automatically flattened. The comma means that it&#39;s not a single argument even though there isn&#39;t a second argument. That isn&#39;t flattened. Notice the extra structure:

<pre class="brush:perl">
% perl 6
&gt; my @array = &lt;a b c&gt;
[a b c]
&gt; my @p = [ @array ]
[a b c]
&gt; my @p = [ @array, ]
[[a b c]]
</pre> 

When I initialize <code>@A</code>, which is the structure that I want to change, I flatten the first element with the <code>|</code>. 

<h3>In-place swapping</h3>

Many other places I looked followed the pseudocode that checked the cursor and then called one of two swap operations:

<pre class="brush:perl">
			if i is even then
				swap(A[0], A[i])
			else
				swap(A[c[i]], A[i])
			end if
</pre> 

I&#39;ll choose the right index and put that into the slices:

<pre class="brush:perl">
			my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
			@A[$swap-index, $i] = @A[$i, $swap-index];
</pre> 

<h3>Cloning</h3>

Each time I create a new permutation I add it to <code>@permutations</code>. But, I don&#39;t want to keep adding the same object because that object will keep moving it&#39;s elements around. I want to preserve the order each time so I call <code>clone</code>. I probably overuse that method.

<pre class="brush:perl">
@permutations.push: @A.clone;
</pre> 

I could have done something different, such as using <code>.List</code> to make a new list out of the current state of the array. I wasn&#39;t thinking too hard about what I wanted on the other side but it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;d want something mutable.

<pre class="brush:perl">
@permutations.push: @A.List;
</pre> 

<h2>Make it a sequence, part 1</h2>

The solution that I translated created all the permutations. That&#39;s okay for small lists but not so good for bigger ones. Perl 6 has user-defined sequences. These are lazy and don&#39;t create the next item until it needs to. Could I make this a sequence using the <code>...</code> operator? Mostly I&#39;m doing this to see if it would work because I&#39;ve been playing with other weird sequences. I certainly don&#39;t encourage this.

I can use a code reference to decide the next thingy. If that code reference takes arguments, it gets that number of the prior elements in the sequence. I&#39;d like to get the first element to initialize the <code>@A</code>. After that I just ignore the argument.

I have to adjust the code a bit to end with the right thing. I can&#39;t <code>return</code> because this is not a routine. It&#39;s just a <code>Block</code>. I&#39;ll use <code>$next</code> for that.

I don&#39;t particularly like my solution but this is where I ran out of steam:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $array = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

my $code-ref = -&gt; ( *@a ) { 
	state $i = 0;
	state @A = @a.clone;
	state @c = (0) xx @A.elems;

	my $next;
	
	loop {
		if @c[$i] &lt; $i {
			my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
			@A[$swap-index, $i] = @A[$i, $swap-index];
			$next = @A.clone;
			@c[$i]++;
			$i = 0;
			last;
			}
		else {
			@c[$i] = 0;
			$i++;
			}

		last unless $i &lt; @A.elems; 
		}

	$next;
	}

sub make-sequence ( $a --&gt; Seq ) { $a, $code-ref ...^ !*.defined }

my $seq = make-sequence( $array );

for @$seq -&gt; $next { 
	put $next;
	}
</pre>

<h2>Make it a sequence, part 2</h2>

The <code>...</code> worked but is pretty ugly. As Michael mentioned in the comments I should have used <code>gather</code> for this. This generates a <code>Seq</code> (similar to Python&#39;s <code>yield</code>). The <code>gather</code> block is the sequence and every <code>take</code> can generate one or more elements for the sequence. The code only runs to the point that it gets another element; when you want another element the code resumes where it left off. If the code finishes without encountering another <code>take</code> (like when this <code>while</code> is done) the sequence is exhausted:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub heaps-sequence ( *@a --&gt; Seq:D ) {
	gather {
		state $i = 0;
		state @c = (0) xx @a.elems;
		take @a.List;

		while $i &lt;  @a.elems {
			if @c[$i] &lt; $i {
				my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
				@a[$swap-index, $i] = @a[$i, $swap-index];
				take @a.List;
				@c[$i]++;
				$i = 0;
				}
			else {
				@c[$i] = 0;
				$i++
				}
			}
		}
	}

my $seq = heaps-sequence( <1 2 3> );

for @$seq -&gt; $next {
	put $next;
	last if $next &gt; 10;
	}
</1></pre>

$giver&lt;wallet given&gt; Z+= (-$amount, $amount)
</pre>

I was playing around with a <a href="http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2017/06/19/counterintuitive-problem-everyone-room-keeps-giving-dollars-random-others-youll-never-guess-happens-next/">simulation problem from Uri Wilensky</a> (R&#39;s <code>gganimate</code> is pretty cool, and pretty and cool). 

That&#39;s the same thing as writing out both sides:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$giver&lt;wallet given&gt; = $giver&lt;wallet given&gt; Z+ ( -$amount, $amount )
</pre>

But, I also could have used a hyper here:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$giver&lt;wallet given&gt; &gt;&gt;+=&lt;&lt; ( -$amount, $amount )
</pre>

I&#39;ve longed wished for this sort of thing in Perl 5, and I think I&#39;ve strained various unmaintainable kludges to get it. Even these Perl 6 expressions might be too mind bending for the work-a-day maintainer.

And, for what it&#39;s worth, the results are pretty much what I expected despite the those Ph.D.s guessing incorrectly. But then, I also have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716710889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0716710889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hashbang09-20&amp;linkId=d67a7004d58db1f05afe368c4421e067" target="_blank">statistical thermodynamics</a> book with arm&#39;s reach of my keyboard. A closed system with a fixed number of particles and a fixed amount of energy where particles can transfer energy to other particles is a type of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/093570258X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=093570258X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hashbang09-20&amp;linkId=2bba09bd19d4454e380924f053b57929" target="_blank">Spherical Cow</a>. The system can exist in any of its microstates. Particle identity aside, some distributions of energy are more probable. The one that everyone might guess, that all particles will have the close to the same energy, just isn&#39;t that likely. But, this isn&#39;t a physics blog.

Perl 6 averages &quot;floating point&quot; numbers correctly. That&#39;s an interesting statement because it seems like it should be obvious and expected. However, people around computers long enough are used to round-off error. Sinan √ún√ºr wrote <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2015/03/how-you-average-numbers.html">How you average numbers matters</a> to show the curious compounding of small effects. He shows some Perl 5 code:

<!--more-->

<pre class="brush:perl">
my @data = (1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) x 50_000;
printf &quot;Naive mean:                  %f\n&quot;, (sum @data) / @data;
</pre>

This outputs the wrong answer instead of 500,000,000.6:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Naive mean:                  500000000.600916
</pre>

I wanted to try this in Perl 6 and had been putting it off thinking I might have to do a work to see what&#39;s going on.

<pre class="brush:perl">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 50_000;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @data) / @data.elems;
</pre>

But no, Perl 6 give the right answer:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
</pre>

You can expand the example to show the identity of the first object in the list. The <code>.^name</code> meta method will tell you that:

<pre class="brush:perl">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 50_000;
put @data[0].^name;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @data) / @data.elems;
</pre>

You see that the first thing (and all the other things) is a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a>, Perl 6&#39;s builtin rational number type:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Rat
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
</pre>

Perl 6 stored the number as a ratio instead of a floating point number. It stays as an exact value. You can add a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> and another <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> and get another exact value in the resultant <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a>. You can keep doing that almost as long as you like as long as Perl 6 can represent the numerator and denominator (and it reduces the fraction as it goes along). Beyond that there&#39;s a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/FatRat">FatRat</a> that can take you even further.

You can sort it ascending or descending, like Sinan did. In his examples, each order got a different answer in the end. You can try that in the Perl 6 version:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 5;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @data) / @data.elems;

my @asc  = @data.sort: &amp;infix:¬´<=>¬ª;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @asc) / @asc.elems;

my @desc = @asc.reverse;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @desc) / @desc.elems;
</=></pre>

But, every mean gives the same answer:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
</pre>

So, there&#39;s nothing to see here. At least it&#39;s off my to-do list. Many of the things Sinan sends me requires long reads and working out math by hand, but this was easy.

You can still have some small effects in the final operation to turn the rational number into a floating point, but that&#39;s something unrelated to the averaging.

<hr>

There are a few other interesting things in the simple code which I&#39;ll cover quickly:

The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/reduce">reduction operator</a>, <code>[+]</code> is a quick way to type that you want to apply that operation between every item in the list. You don&#39;t have to use the addition operator. You can put almost anything in there.

<hr>

The <code>xx</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/xx">list repetition operator</a>. But, I want each list to combine into a flatten larger list. The <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Slip#sub_slip">slip</a></code> causes an inner list to lose its list structure and become separate items in the larger list. Without the <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Slip#sub_slip">slip</a></code> you&#39;d get a list of 50,000 sublists. Try it with only five sublists:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @data = (1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 5;
say @data;
</pre>

The <code>@data</code> array has five items, all of which are lists:

<pre class="brush:plain">
[(1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1)]
</pre>

Now add the <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Slip#sub_slip">slip</a></code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 5;
say @data;
</pre>

The array now has is flat. The sublist inserted their items into the larger list without the structure:

<pre class="brush:plain">
[1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1]
</pre>
