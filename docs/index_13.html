		<div class="excerpt">





Rakudo comes with a built-in profiler. Invoke the program with the <code>--profiler</code> option and

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 --profiler some_script.p6
... output ...
Writing profiler output to profile-1480712222.02931.html
</pre>

That profile is an HTML file using Bootstrap and other fun things to make it look pretty. It&#39;s not as sophisticated as something like Perl 5&#39;s <a href="https://www.metacpan.org/module/Devel::NYTProf">Devel::NYTProf</a>, but it&#39;s still pretty interesting. <!--more-->

Let&#39;s write some routines to do Fibonacci numbers, which seem to be most authors&#39; favorite example for this sort of thing. Indeed, I used it in the &quot;Benchmarking&quot; chapter of <a href="http://www.masteringperl.org">Mastering Perl</a>, but mostly to point out how wrong the simple benchmarks were.

I&#39;ll implement it in four ways, none of which I claim to be the best:

<ul>
<li>The recursive way you see in most examples
</li><li>A recursive fashion with memoization
</li><li>Using the sequence operator
</li><li>Using memoization with an iterative approach.
</li></ul>

In <a href="http://www.masteringperl.org">Mastering Perl</a>, I presented a few arguments that escape the usual discussion:

<ul>
<li>The routine that runs fastest the first time isn&#39;t necessarily the best
</li><li>Caching results you&#39;ll use again eventually pays off in time
</li><li>Using less time usually means using less memory
</li><li>You improve with better algorithms instead of different syntax.
</li></ul>

Here are some implementations in Perl 6, where I didn&#39;t try at all to make them efficient. I merely want something to show the workings of the profiler:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub fib_recursive ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	return 1 if $n <2; $n ( ) * + - 1 2 fib_recursive( fib_recursive_memoize int return sub where }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state @n = ( 1, 1 );

	return @n[$n] if $n <@n.elems; $n ( ) * + - 1 2 @n[$n]="fib_recursive_memoize(" fib_recursive_memoize( fib_sequence int return sub where }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	my $seq := 1, 1, * + * ... *;
	$seq[$n]
	}

sub fib_memoize ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state @n = ( 1, 1 );
	return @n[$n] if $n <@n.elems; $n - .. @n.elems for> $index {
		@n[$index] = @n[$index-1] + @n[$index-2];
		}

	@n[*-1]
	}

sub MAIN ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	for 1 .. 10 {
		say fib_recursive( $n );
		say fib_recursive_memoize( $n );
		say fib_sequence( $n );
		say fib_memoize( $n );
		}
	}
</@n.elems;></@n.elems;></2;></pre>

I run this program under the profiler, and if I&#39;ve everything correctly, I should see the same number output several times. Or, I&#39;ve done it wrong the same way each time.

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ perl6 --profile fib.p6 20
10946
10946
.....
10946
10946
Writing profiler output to profile-1480712222.02931.html
</pre>

If you don&#39;t like that filename, you can choose your own:

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ perl6 --profile --profile-filename=fibonacci.html fib.p6 20
10946
10946
.....
10946
10946
Writing profiler output to fibonacci.html
</pre>

I can then look at the profiler output. Here&#39;s a screenshot that shows the time spent in each of the subroutines:

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="250" src="/images/fibonacci_profiler.png" width="500">
</div>
</div>

To see the rest of the report, run the program yourself!

I won&#39;t write too much about interpreting these results, but there are several things you should think about in these sorts of comparisons.

First, test with a variety of values, especially those of vastly different orders of magnitude. The recursive solution might look really fast for small <i>N</i>, but it gets bad very quickly.

Second, test it several times, as I&#39;ve done in this example. Some implementations always take the same amount of time while others get faster and faster. In a program where this level of optimization matters, you&#39;re likely to run the interesting routine several times.

Third, consider a completely different approach than any you see here. The Fibonacci numbers aren&#39;t going to change (neither are the values of other sequences). Why compute them again? Just look them up. (I&#39;ll write more about this tomorrow when <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/2016/12/03/quick-tip-18-short-circuit-subroutines-with-multi/">I use multi subs</a>) Something like Redis can store huge lists without eating all your resources or complicating your program.

Perl 6 has several sophisticated ways to make lists. I was playing with a particular task where I needed combinations for something similar to bin packing.

I have a list of items and I want to combine those into other lists of a particular length. Duplication doesn&#39;t matter (so, not sets), although later I&#39;ll want to filter the lists on some utility function. That&#39;s not the interesting bit. <!--more-->

Create a list, and specify a length. Imagine a loop where the length gets bigger:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; my @n = &lt;1 2 3&gt;;
[1 2 3]
&gt; my $n = 4;
4
</pre>

Now for the fancy stuff. The <code>xx</code> replicates the list. It&#39;s not flat. I get a list that has that number of lists. Yep, Perl 6 has proper lists of lists. 

Then, I take that list of lists and reduce it with a cross operator. I end up with a bunch of lists of length <code>$n</code> in all the combinations:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( [X] ( @n xx $n ) )
((1 1 1 1) (1 1 1 2) (1 1 1 3) (1 1 2 1) (1 1 2 2) (1 1 2 3) 
(1 1 3 1) (1 1 3 2) (1 1 3 3) (1 2 1 1) (1 2 1 2) (1 2 1 3) 
(1 2 2 1) (1 2 2 2) (1 2 2 3) (1 2 3 1) (1 2 3 2) (1 2 3 3) 
(1 3 1 1) (1 3 1 2) (1 3 1 3) (1 3 2 1) (1 3 2 2) (1 3 2 3) 
(1 3 3 1) (1 3 3 2) (1 3 3 3) (2 1 1 1) (2 1 1 2) (2 1 1 3) 
(2 1 2 1) (2 1 2 2) (2 1 2 3) (2 1 3 1) (2 1 3 2) (2 1 3 3) 
(2 2 1 1) (2 2 1 2) (2 2 1 3) (2 2 2 1) (2 2 2 2) (2 2 2 3) 
(2 2 3 1) (2 2 3 2) (2 2 3 3) (2 3 1 1) (2 3 1 2) (2 3 1 3) 
(2 3 2 1) (2 3 2 2) (2 3 2 3) (2 3 3 1) (2 3 3 2) (2 3 3 3) 
(3 1 1 1) (3 1 1 2) (3 1 1 3) (3 1 2 1) (3 1 2 2) (3 1 2 3) 
(3 1 3 1) (3 1 3 2) (3 1 3 3) (3 2 1 1) (3 2 1 2) (3 2 1 3) 
(3 2 2 1) (3 2 2 2) (3 2 2 3) (3 2 3 1) (3 2 3 2) (3 2 3 3) 
(3 3 1 1) (3 3 1 2) (3 3 1 3) (3 3 2 1) (3 3 2 2) (3 3 2 3) 
(3 3 3 1) (3 3 3 2) (3 3 3 3))
</pre>

Note that permutations are different, and that&#39;s even easier because there&#39;s a method for that:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; @n.permutations
((1 2 3) (1 3 2) (2 1 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2) (3 2 1))
</pre>

But, let&#39;s do it step by step.

First, I have a list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3)
( 1 2 3 )
</pre>

Now, I want to replicate it. I can do that to get two lists in a bigger list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3) xx 2
((1 2 3) (1 2 3))
</pre>

As a side note, if you don&#39;t like that, you could &quot;de-containerize&quot; (using <code>|</code>) the small list so it loses its structure:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; |(1, 2, 3) xx 2
(1 2 3 1 2 3)
</pre>

I want to keep the structure, however, so I can combine two copies of the list. The next step is a cross. Here I do it by hand:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3) X ( 1, 2, 3 )
((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3))
</pre>

That&#39;s not so bad. The cross makes little lists of the first element of the first list and all the elements of the second list in turn. Then with the second element, and so on. The big list is a bunch of two element little lists.

Now, do that as a reduction. With two lists, it&#39;s the same result:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)
((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3))
</pre>

But, try it with three lists. The lefthand cross gives the result I&#39;ve already shown. There&#39;s one more cross to go. Take the first element, <code>(1, 1)</code> and combine it with <code>1</code> to get <code>(1, 1, 1)</code>. And, do all of those:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3) X ( 1, 2, 3 ) X ( 1, 2, 3 )
...
&gt;  ((1, 1) ... (3, 3))    X ( 1, 2, 3 )
((1 1 1) (1 1 2) ... (3 3 2) (3 3 3))
</pre>

The reduction operator does that for me. It takes two elements, does the operation, and puts the result back on the list. Then it takes that element and the next element and does the operation again. It keeps doing that until there&#39;s one element. I can cross as many times as I like without repeatedly typing it. This is the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] (1, 2, 3), ( 1, 2, 3 ), ( 1, 2, 3 )
...
</pre>

And, I already know how to replicate the list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] (1, 2, 3) xx 3
((1 1 1) (1 1 2) ... (3 3 2) (3 3 3))
</pre>

Now, I put that list in a variable and the count in another variable:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] @n xx $n
( ... )
</pre>

The combinatorial explosion might wreck the computer, but that&#39;s why they make bigger computers. And, later, Perl 6 will let things happen in parallel.

But, I said that I wanted to apply a utility function to these. I can <code>grep</code> those:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( [X] @n xx 5 ).grep( { .sum &gt; 13 } )
((2 3 3 3 3) (3 2 3 3 3) (3 3 2 3 3) (3 3 3 2 3) (3 3 3 3 2) (3 3 3 3 3))
</pre>

But, I can do better than that! Oh yeah, it gets better. I want to partition the big set. I can call <code>categorize</code>. The string I return is which hash key the item &quot;belongs&quot; to. I get a hash back, and each key has an array with the values associated with that key:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( [X] @n xx 5 ).categorize( { .sum &gt; 13 ?? &#39;pass&#39; !! &#39;fail&#39; } )
{fail =&gt; [(1 1 1 1 1) ... (3 3 3 3 1)], pass =&gt; [(2 3 3 3 3) (3 2 3 3 3) (3 3 2 3 3) (3 3 3 2 3) (3 3 3 3 2) (3 3 3 3 3)]}
</pre>

This sort of thing replaces several Perl 5 modules I&#39;ve written where I had to manage arrays of arrays to build tuples.

I&#39;m working on chapter that I need to turn in to O&#39;Reilly and I keep typing &quot;Perl 6&quot;. It&#39;s annoying. But, what else would I call it? I&#39;m not looking to change the name, just the nickname in the book. <!--more-->

<iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGtq1GlmaAw" width="560"></iframe>

I&#39;m not annoyed because a previous language shares the name. No matter what I think that&#39;s a done deal. I&#39;m more annoyed that it takes some much typing and is repetitive. In <a href="//www.learning-perl.com/">Learning Perl</a>, I often said things like &quot;v5.24 does this&quot; of &quot;v5.10 did that&quot; without saying the magic word. What if I said &quot;v6&quot;? For instance, the sentence, &quot;In v6, the match operator immediately applies the pattern to $_.&quot; 

But, I think that also implies that it&#39;s a change from earlier versions. What about &quot;P6&quot;? It&#39;s the same thing. I could say &quot;QP&quot; for &quot;Quite Perl 6&quot; ;)

I&#39;m talking about the language, not the implementation, so saying &quot;Rakudo&quot;, &quot;Rakudo Star&quot;, &quot;R*&quot; or the like aren&#39;t right.

And, when are we going to get an implementation named Camelia? ;)

		<div class="byline">
		<span class="author">brian</span> • <span class="date">November 30, 2016</span>
</div>

		<div class="excerpt">





Perl 6 has phasers, which are subroutines that run at particular times despite their spatial placement inside the the program text. As a program moves from one thing to another, it might trigger a phaser. I wanted to use a cute title like &quot;Phasers set to stun!&quot;, but <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/day-15-phasers-set-to-stun/">Jonathan Worthington got there first in the 2012 Perl 6 Advent Calendar</a>. (And, tomorrow is the first day of the <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com">2016 Perl 6 Advent Calendar</a>). <!--more-->

For instance, there&#39;s a boundary once the compiler has compiled the program and when the main execution of the program is about to begin. Or, when the program enters or leaves a block.

Here are the <code>NEXT</code> and <code>LAST</code> block phasers:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 3 -&gt; $item {
	put &quot;$item: I&#39;m the last statement in this block&quot;;
	NEXT { say &quot;NEXT: About to move onto next iteration&quot; }
	LAST { say &quot;LAST: I&#39;m not running this block again&quot; }
	}
</pre>

The output shows that the <code>put</code> outputs its message, then the <code>NEXT</code> does. After all the iterations, the <code>LAST</code> runs:

<pre class="brush:plain">
0: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
1: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
2: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
3: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
LAST: I&#39;m not running this block again
</pre>

But, I can rearrange the statements and get the same output:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 3 -&gt; $item {
	LAST { say &quot;LAST: I&#39;m not running this block again&quot; }
	NEXT { say &quot;NEXT: About to move onto next iteration&quot; }
	put &quot;$item: I&#39;m the last statement in this block&quot;;
	}
</pre>

The phasers are attached to Perl 6&#39;s block handling and aren&#39;t really part of the statements inside the block even though that&#39;s where I declared them.

But, since I declared the phasers inside the block, they can bind to variables in that scope. Here I can output a message after the last iteration:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 15 -&gt; $item {
	state $count = 0;
	if $item.is-prime {
		put &quot;$item is prime&quot;;
		$count++;
		}
	LAST { say &quot;There were $count primes&quot; }
	}
</pre>

That&#39;s really cool! I like this much more than adding another, outer scope to handle the variable and the final message:

<pre class="brush:plain">
{
my $count;
for 0 .. 15 -&gt; $item {
	if $item.is-prime {
		put &quot;$item is prime&quot;;
		$count++;
		}
	}
say &quot;There were $count primes&quot;;
}
</pre>

Note that even though the phasers don&#39;t particularly care about their textual position, the compiler needs to have already seen anything you want the phaser to reference. This won&#39;t work because <code>$count</code> doesn&#39;t exist yet:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 15 -&gt; $item {
	LAST { say &quot;There were $count primes&quot; }  # $count not compiled yet
	state $count = 0;
	if $item.is-prime {
		put &quot;$item is prime&quot;;
		$count++;
		}
	}
</pre>


Here&#39;s a program the shows many of the phasers:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

# Program execution
BEGIN  { put &quot;BEGIN, at compile time as soon as possible&quot; }
CHECK  { put &quot;CHECK, at compile time, as late as possible&quot; }
INIT   { put &quot;INIT, during main execution, as soon as possible&quot; }
END    { put &quot;END, during main execution, as late as possible&quot; }

for 0 .. 3 -&gt; $item {
	my Int $square = $item ** 2;

	# Block phasers
	ENTER { say &quot;\tENTER block&quot; }
	LEAVE { say &quot;\tLEAVE block&quot; }
	KEEP  { say &quot;KEEP block: Got value $_&quot;  } # not implemented?
	UNDO  { say &quot;\t\tUNDO block&quot;  }
	PRE   { say &quot;PRE block ------&quot;  } # before running block
	POST  { say &quot;POST block&quot; }        # after running block, before leaving

	# Loop phasers
	FIRST { say &quot;\tFIRST loop&quot; } # first one when beginning looping
	NEXT  { say &quot;\tNEXT loop&quot;  } # last one while looping
	LAST  { say &quot;\tLAST loop&quot;; say &quot;**** LOOP is done ****&quot;  } # last one when done looping
	}
</pre>
