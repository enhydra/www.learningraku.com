<i>Learning Perl 6</i> won&#39;t be renamed <i>Learning Raku</i> until at soonest the next major release cycle (maybe in a couple of years), although the latest cover for the reprint says &quot;Covers Raku&quot; in the upper right banner. However, if you have a digital version, you might like to replace your digital cover with this one I mocked up and is completely unofficial and unauthorized (<a href="/images/cover-large-raku.png">PNG</a>, <a href="/images/cover-large-raku.pdf">PDF</a>):

Brad Gilbert say my Effective Perl post about script runs (a stable feature in v5.32) and <a href="  https://twitter.com/b2gills/status/1239987592197738506">offered this Raku version on Twitter</a>:
</p>

<pre class="brush:plain"># Perl 5:  /(*script_run:(\d+))/
/ \d+  &lt;?{ [eq] $/.Str.uniprops(&#39;script&#39;) }&gt; /
</pre>

<p>
Basically, it matches <code>\d+</code> then immediately uses an assertion that looks that the thing it just matched, <code>$/</code>, has characters with all the same Unicode properties.

In October 2019, <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tpf-response-raku-rename">Perl 6 changed its name to Raku</a>. I think it&#39;s a good move to let the language stand on its own two feet.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve updated the older domains for this blog to permanently redirect to the new <i>www.learningraku.com</i>. I&#39;d already changed the Twitter account to <i><a href="https://twitter.com/LearningRaku">@LearningRaku</a></i>. If you run into something that doesn&#39;t work, let me know.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also exploring how I can change the name of the printed and e-books. Since the book is created by print-on-demand, that might not be too hard. It could take some time since I&#39;d also take the chance to update the book for current Raku behavior.
</p>
<p>
Various parts of the Raku community will change their names, labels, and references in the coming weeks as people have time to deal with the huge effort. <a href="https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3046">You might even be able to help</a>.

Learning Perl 6 has its first translation. I know that the translators worked hard on it because I answered many questions for them. It is on sale now at <a href="https://www.kingstone.com.tw/new/basic/2014713579683">KingStone</a> and <a href="https://www.tenlong.com.tw/products/9789865021382">Ten Long</a> and probably other places.

Rakudo Star 2018.10 is now in Chocolatey as the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/rakudostar">rakudostar</a> package. There&#39;s something to note here: Steve Mynott has he&#39;s not going to prepare another Rakudo Star release. That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t going to be more releases—just that someone else needs to prepare them.

Most O&#39;Reilly books have extensive previews on Google Books, and that&#39;s true for the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sbRqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=yy9KUe-W4Y&amp;dq=learning%20perl%206%3A%20keeping%20the%20easy%2C%20hard%2C%20and%20impossible%20within%20reach%20brian%20d.%20foy&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=learning%20perl%206:%20keeping%20the%20easy,%20hard,%20and%20impossible%20within%20reach%20brian%20d.%20foy&amp;f=false">Learning Perl 6 preview</a> too. You can check out the beginning of the book. If you like it you can buy the rest. Unfortunately the exercise answers are at the end of the book and not shown in the repo.

Now that we know how big the book is (a literal measurement), we know how wide the spine is (<a href="https://www.programmingperl.org/2012/03/20-years-of-programming-perl/">note the physical comparisons I did for <i>Programming Perl</i></a>). The page size is already fixed. From there we create cover that wraps the paper. Here it is:

		<description><![CDATA[Now that the book is done I have the <a href="/downloads/LearningPerl6_TOC.pdf">table of contents (PDF)</a>. That&#39;s quite a feat considering I re-ordered some chapters only a couple of months ago! The end of this post also contains a text version that&#39;s slightly outdated since it comes from my original sources before the editors adjusted some things. The content is essentially the same though.

Since I&#39;ve just finished the last quality control cycle with O&#39;Reilly, I expect that the print version will ship in three weeks (but that&#39;s merely a historical expectation, not a promise).

		<description><![CDATA[You can now <a href="https://goo.gl/KHavUw">pre-order Learning Perl 6 (Amazon US link)</a>. You&#39;ve been able to do that for awhile but I didn&#39;t want to say anything until I knew it was going to be a book. Since I turned in the book to O&#39;Reilly yesterday and it entered production today, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s happening now.

One of the curious effects of the publishing world is that all pre-orders count as first week sales. That means that books have months to collect orders that count when they are actually fulfilled. Of course, this means that people game the system to bump their books up in the charts for a bit.

If you were a KickStarter backer you don&#39;t need to order the book. I&#39;ll collect your details when the books are available and I&#39;ll send them to you myself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve been fooling around with <a href="/2018/03/15/use-pre-built-rakudo-packages-on-travis-ci/">pre-built Rakudo packages on Travis CI</a> so I figured that I should do the same on AppVeyor. Last night I had a <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/briandfoy/venturi/build/1.0.12/job/ahmktqs4ynu5u7x2">Ubuntu build that ran out of memory</a> before it could finish compiling Rakudo and it gave up. <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/getting-started-with-appveyor-for-linux/">AppVeyor is rolling out Linux support</a> and I suspect their initial machines are underpowered (especially the ones I get for free—completely reasonable) but I haven&#39;t investigated it. It&#39;s certainly easier than the Pugs installations which could take days although much of that was just GHC. <!--more-->

The Windows side is easy because I use the <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">rakudo-star chocolatey package</a>.

This configuration is mostly the same as <a href="/2018/03/15/use-pre-built-rakudo-packages-on-travis-ci/">what I am doing on Travis</a> but translated to a configuration that&#39;s handling Windows and Linux at the same time. Lines starting with <code>sh:</code> are run on Linux only; lines with no prefix are run on both systems.

		<description><![CDATA[I changed my Perl 6 Travis setup so I&#39;m not using the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/community-supported-languages/">community supported</a> Perl 6. That one builds rakudo and sometimes it exhausts the memory. Even if it didn&#39;t do that it takes awhile to get to the things I want to test. My new configuration takes the run time from about 7 to under 2 minutes. <!--more-->

<a href="https://github.com/nxadm">Claudio Ramirez</a> provides some <a href="https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg">pre-built Rakudo packages for Linux</a>. I can install those instead of building Rakudo. To do that I can&#39;t declare a language (or can declare some language that in the base image). Declaring  &quot;perl6&quot; builds rakudo—maybe someone will change the community edition to use the pre-built package.

I still have a problem with the URL to get the pre-built package. There is a URL to get the latest package by <a href="https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/lib.js">redirecting through some javascript</a>. It&#39;s not something that needs to happen in Javascript since the answers don&#39;t change and we could have a static page. That&#39;s maybe something I can work on later—or maybe you can. Put the direct links in the README and regenerate that when the packages change (monthly).

This is working nicely so far and I can improve on it later:

		<title>Coercion types in signatures don't work and won't for awhile</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2018/03/14/coercion-types-in-signatures-dont-work-and-wont-for-awhile/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2018 09:26:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to make a method that took an integer or a string that looked like an integer. I thought a coercion type would work nicely for that. The <code>Int</code> is the target type and <code>Str</code> is the type it will accept then coerce:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub something ( Int:D(Str:D) $n ) { ... }

something( 37 );
something( &quot;137&quot; );
something( &quot;Hello&quot; ); # I want this to fail
something( 1.5 );     # I want this to fail too
</pre>

That didn&#39;t quite work out. If I pass it a <code>Str</code> it calls <code>.Int</code>. A string like <code>&quot;1.5&quot;</code> converts just fine because the <code>.Int</code> not only changes types but can change the data. We are used to <code>int()</code> as a way to make floating point numbers into whole numbers. So, <code>.Int</code> has two jobs: managing types and managing values. I don&#39;t like that and don&#39;t think that 3.14 is 3. I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/49262872/2766176">asked about it on StackOverflow</a> and got some interesting answers. Brad Gilbert shows <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49280457/2766176">the long hard way</a> which is close to what I was already doing but there&#39;s no need for the coercion type then. I was a little disappointed.

Then I wondered what would happen if a <code>.Int</code> method did not return the right sort of type. I didn&#39;t expect this to run without an error (I originally typed &quot;expect this to work&quot;!) but it does. I made an <code>.Int</code> that returned a <code>Str</code>. That&#39;s silly but I can imagine myself making stupid error like this and typing should show my stupidity:

<pre class="brush:plain">
class Foo {
    method Int ( --&gt; Str:D ) { &#39;Hello&#39; }
    }

put try-it( Foo.new );

sub try-it ( Int:D() $n ) { &quot;Got 「$n」 of type 「{$n.^name}」&quot; }
</pre>

Although the subroutine signature demanded an <code>Int</code> it accepted something that claimed to be able to convert but actually didn&#39;t. The <code>.Int</code> method is the right thing to call but there was nothing to check that it did the right thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Got 「Hello」 of type 「Str」
</pre>

I would have expected the runtime constraint to check the ultimate value against the type and this would have failed. But it doesn&#39;t check that the value ends up the correct type. Assigning to a value with a type limitation works though:

<pre class="brush:plain">
class Foo {
	method Int { &quot;Hello&quot; }
	}

my Str $m = Foo.Int;  # works
my Int $n = Foo.Int;  # this fails as expected
</pre>

I filed <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132980">RT 132980</a> which led to some <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#Coercion_Type">clarifications in the documentation</a> but also a note that it&#39;s on the back burner for a fix because the proper type check leads to a slowdown (even if you don&#39;t use it, I take it). The motto of Rakudo had been <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq#Is_Perl_6_fast_enough_for_me?">&quot;make it work right then make it work fast&quot;</a>, but sometimes there are other trade-offs that are more important.]]></description>

		<title>Infinite, cycling sequences</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2018/03/02/infinite-cycling-sequences/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 17:32:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[My <a href="https://www.metacpan.org/module/Tie::Cycle">Tie::Cycle</a> Perl 5 module is almost trivial but it solved a customer problem a long, long time ago. It&#39;s makes a list that looks like a scalar. Every time you access the scalar you get the next value in the list (wrapping around at the end).

How would I do the same thing in Perl 6? I started thinking about a way to make a sequence whose elements were always <code>True</code>, infinitely and forever. I fell back on the idea of cycling through a list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $colors := make-cycle( &lt;red green blue&gt; );

for $colors {
	put $_;
	last if $++ &gt; 5;
	}

sub make-cycle ( *@a --&gt; Seq ) {
	{ @a[ $++ % * ] } ... Inf
	}
</pre>

It loops through all of the colors:

<pre class="brush:plain">
red
green
blue
red
green
blue
red
</pre>

I could have done the same thing with other lists that would cycle forever. Even the trivial list of one item might be useful. This is what I wanted when I started playing with this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $false       := make-cycle( False );
my $true        := make-cycle( True  );
my $true-false  := make-cycle( True, False );
my $false-true  := make-cycle( False, True );
</pre>

The <code>...</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_...">sequence operator</a>. You can use some code to decide what comes next. That includes deciding what comes first. I want to grab the next element of the array. That&#39;s easy. Keep a cursor of the index and add to each each time I grab to something. When it gets too big reset it to the beginning.

Perl 6 has nice syntax for this. All that is in <code>$++ % *</code> that I use for the index in <code>@a[  ]</code>. I need a variable to act as the cursor. I don&#39;t need it anywhere else than inside the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#postcircumfix_[_]">array indexing operator</a>.

The <code>$</code> by itself is an anonymous scalar variable that allows you to skip the declaration; the variable shows up exactly once because that&#39;s how many times I need it. The <code>++</code> is the auto-increment operator to move the cursor along.

The value in <code>$</code> eventually passes the last index of the list. The modulus operator <code>%</code> brings it back in that range. For a list of 5 items, the first item is list is at indices 0, 5, 10, and so on. Those are all effectively 0 modulo the number elements.

The <code>*</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> star. What that does depends on where it shows up. In the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#postcircumfix_[_]">array indexing operator</a> it&#39;s the number of elements (not the last index) in the thingy. That&#39;s the same number I need for the modulus.

All together that&#39;s the cryptic <code>$++ % *</code>. It&#39;s a bit tricky to read but I typically don&#39;t start writing code like that unless I&#39;ve done it before. I do it the long way.

I don&#39;t even need the <code>make-cycle</code> factory (although it&#39;s convenient to forget how this works). I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want this all over my code even if I can do it:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $seq := { ( &lt;red green blue&gt; )[ $++ % * ] } ... Inf;
</pre>

Even then, <code>Seq.from-loop</code> already does most of the work. I don&#39;t need to use <code>...</code> because this keeps going by always calling the block of code to get the next value:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $seq := Seq.from-loop: { ( &lt;red green blue&gt; )[ $++ % *] };
</pre>

It could be a module but this isn&#39;t node.]]></description>

		<title>The Universal Set</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2018/02/16/the-universal-set/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 01:55:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Some people like to think you can&#39;t have a universal set. I say otherwise. The difference is what you can do about it.

Perl 6 has the empty set, <code>∅</code> and nothing is a member of that set:

<pre class="brush:plain">
if $a ∈ ∅ { put &#39;Never executes!&#39; } # always False
</pre>

This is easy to construct with a set of no elements:

<pre class="brush:plain">
if $a ∈ set() { put &#39;Never executes!&#39; } # always False
</pre>

Perl 6 can construct sets from finite sequences but I wondered about infinite ones. The universal set, <code>𝕌</code>, contains everything (although that causes some problems the set theorists haven&#39;t figured out other than to say &quot;Don&#39;t do that&quot;).

But if I can figure out set membership without enumerating the members of the set I can make it work:

<pre class="brush:plain">
            # Double struck letters
class 𝕌 {}; # Universal, U+1D54C but wordpress don&#39;t like that

multi infix:<∈> ( Any:_ $c, 𝕌:U $ --&gt; Bool ) { True }

use Test;

ok any(1,2) ∈ 𝕌, &#39;(Junction) is part of the universal set&#39;;
ok   Any    ∈ 𝕌, &#39;(Any) is part of the universal set&#39;;
ok   37     ∈ 𝕌, &#39;Int:D is part of the universal set&#39;;
ok  &#39;37&#39;    ∈ 𝕌, &#39;Integer string is part of the universal set&#39;;
ok   𝕌      ∈ 𝕌, &#39;Universal set contains itself? Not so sure...&#39;;
ok   ∅      ∈ 𝕌, &#39;Universal set contains the empty set&#39;;

done-testing();
</∈></pre>

The trick is to figure out how to represent a set difference with a universal set. I know what the complement of that set so I need to flip around the operators. I&#39;m still working out some other things (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48819031/2766176">Where did my Perl 6 operator go after I defined a more specific multi?</a> for one hiccup) to make the set operators work, though.]]></description>

I&#39;m not going to waste too much time in the book explaining any particular operating system. I want to save space and I know I&#39;ll probably want to keep updating those bits anyway. Here are some hints for Windows. While writing the book I test stuff with Windows 10 and a particular workflow that I liked well enough. You might like something different (and if you do you probably don&#39;t need these instructions). <!--more-->

And I need these instructions because I&#39;m not a regular Windows user. I&#39;ve also written about this setup in <a href="https://www.windowsperl.com/2018/01/18/my_windows_environment/">my Windows Perl site</a> so I won&#39;t repeat most of it here. If you have a different setup that works for you let me know about it.


<h2>The Chocolatey package manager</h2>

I use the <a href="https://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey</a> package manager to get most of what I need; that includes <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/rakudostar">Rakudo Star</a>, and <a href="https://conemu.github.io">ConEmu</a> Follow its installation instructions to install that from a PowerShell administrator window:

<pre class="brush:plain">
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; choco install rakudostar
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; choco install ConEmu
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; choco install notepadplusplus
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; choco install git
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; refreshenv
</pre>

<h2>Check your programs</h2>

After you install Rakudo and refresh the environment try a simple invocation from the command line. You can check the version. You should get something like this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
C:\Users\hamadryas&gt; perl6 -v
This is Rakudo Star version 2017.10 built on MoarVM version 2017.10
implementing Perl 6.c.
</pre>

<h2>Edit a file</h2>

Somehow create and edit a file. If you installed NotePad++ you can run it from the command line:

<pre class="brush:plain">
C:\Users\hamadryas&gt; notepad++ hello-perl6.p6
</pre>

Put in this text:

<pre class="brush:plain">
#!perl6
put &#39;Hello Perl 6&#39;;
</pre>

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img src="/images/windows-setup/notepad-hello.png" style="border: 1px solid">
</div>
</div>

<h2>Run a file</h2>

<pre class="brush:plain">
C:\Users\hamadryas&gt; perl6 hello-perl6.p6
</pre>

		<title>Custom operators for Knuth's Arrow</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2018/01/18/525/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2018 09:28:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[[mathjax]

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Wikipedia page for Knuth&#39;s up arrow notation</a> makes some claims about superscripts:

<blockquote>
But many environments — such as programming languages and plain-text e-mail — do not support superscript typesetting.
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

I&#39;ll ignore the claim that plain text (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">their parochial definition</a>) is the same thing as 7-bit text ASCII.

The first claim, however, isn&#39;t strictly true for Perl 6 and probably many other more esoteric languages (let me know if you know which ones you know about). It got me thinking about what I could do in Perl 6.

Perl 6 uses superscripts as operators defined in the core language. I found this out between the time they were implemented and later documented when <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/34689850/2766176">I tried to use them in variable names</a>. Now I can write some exponentiations with superscripts:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $square = $n²;  # valid Perl 6, same as $n ** 2
</pre>

I can&#39;t superscript superscripts or superscript superscripts of superscripts though and that&#39;s what most of that claim is about. Adding a character that is already a superscript isn&#39;t the point. We typically don&#39;t type something like these <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerTower.html">power towers</a> directly without some sort of being-the-scenes formatting instructions (so, not plain text). I do this with \(\LaTeX\):

$$x^{2^{2^2}}$$

$$a^{b^{b^b}}$$

$$a^{some^{other^{terms}}}$$

But Perl 6 also provides builtin features that it fully expects people to use to extend the language. I can create these operators myself. (Note that in mathematics, the up arrow is an example of a hyperoperator but that has a completely different meaning from the Perl 6 <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Hyper_Operators">hyperoperators</a> that apply an operation to corresponding elements of two lists.)

I can create an up-arrow operator, <code>↑</code>. Had I googled first I would have found that it&#39;s already been done in <a href="https://github.com/ajs/perl6-Math-Arrow/blob/master/lib/Math/Arrow.pm">Math::Arrow</a>.

A single up arrow is the same as exponentiation but without a superscript. The operand on the left is raised to the power on the right. It&#39;s in the progression of <code>+</code> for addition, <code>*</code> for multiplication, and then <code>↑</code> for exponentation. This is the basis for higher orders later.

It&#39;s a binary infix operator (takes two operands and goes in the middle) so I add my symbols in the angle brackets after the <code>infix:</code>. I specify that it&#39;s right associative (as is exponentiation) and that it has the same precedence as exponentiation:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub infix:&lt;↑&gt; ( Int:D \n, Int:D \m  --&gt; Int:D )
	is equiv(&amp;infix:&lt;**&gt;)
	is assoc&lt;right&gt;
	{ n ** m }

put 2 ↑  3;  # 2  * 2  * 2 =  8
</pre>

That&#39;s only the starting point. With this notation I can define higher orders of repetition. The double up arrow, <code>↑↑</code>, is repeated exponentiation just like multiplication is repeated addition. The number on the right is one more than the number of exponentiations in the power tower (the other one is the base):

$$2↑↑4 = 2^{2^{2^2}}$$

I make a couple of subroutine definitions here to handle the special cases where the second operand is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> since the reduction operator won&#39;t deal with those cases. Since these subroutines have the same name I use <code>multi</code> to define the candidates. The dispatcher figures out which one fits best and use that:

<pre class="brush:plain">
proto infix:&lt;↑↑&gt; ( Int:D \n, Int:D \m  --&gt; Int:D )
	is tighter(&amp;infix:&lt;↑&gt;)
	is assoc&lt;right&gt;
	{ * }
multi infix:&lt;↑↑&gt; ( \n, 0  ) { 1 }
multi infix:&lt;↑↑&gt; ( \n, 0  ) { \n }
multi infix:&lt;↑↑&gt; ( \n, \m ) { [↑] n xx m }

put 2 ↑  3;  # 2  * 2  * 2 =  8
put 2 ↑↑ 3;  # 2 ** 2 ** 2 = 16
</pre>

The <code>proto</code> defines the basic template for all candidates with the same name. That&#39;s where I can constrain the types of values and set the associativity and precedence. It&#39;s the gatekeeper; once I annotate the types and set the traits I don&#39;t need to annotate them in the candidates (and in some cases can&#39;t re-define them).

I make the double arrow version tighter than the single arrow one I just defined. The <code>*</code> in the <code>proto</code> block dispatches to the best candidate of the same name. The two <code>multis</code> can then assume everything that needs to be checked was already handled.

Now I can extend that to the triple up arrow <code>↑↑↑</code>. It&#39;s the same thing with an additional up arrow:

<pre class="brush:plain">
proto infix:&lt;↑↑↑&gt; ( Int:D \n, Int:D \m  --&gt; Int:D )
	is assoc&lt;right&gt;
	is tighter(&amp;infix:&lt;↑↑&gt;)  { * }
multi infix:&lt;↑↑↑&gt; ( \n,  0 ) { 1 }
multi infix:&lt;↑↑↑&gt; ( \n, \m ) { [↑↑] n xx m }

put 2 ↑   3;  # 2  *  2  * 2  =  8
put 2 ↑↑  3;  # 2 ↑   2 ↑  2  = 16
put 2 ↑↑↑ 3;  # 2 ↑↑ (2 ↑↑ 2) = 256
</pre>

But there&#39;s an alternate notation that goes back further than Knuth&#39;s up arrow. I can define prefix superscripts that denote particular up arrow versions. These use superscripts:

<pre class="brush:plain">
multi prefix:&lt;⁰&gt;  ( Int:D $m ) { 1 }
multi prefix:&lt;²&gt;  ( Int:D $m ) { $m ↑↑ 2 }
multi prefix:&lt;³&gt;  ( Int:D $m ) { $m ↑↑ 3 }
multi prefix:&lt;³&gt;  ( Int:D $m ) { $m ↑↑ 4 }

put ²2;
put ⁴2;
put ²3;
put ³3;
</pre>

There&#39;s yet another notation that doesn&#39;t use repeated arrows. It uses a superscript on the arrow to specify how many arrows there are:

<pre class="brush:plain">
multi infix:&lt;↑²&gt; ( Int:D \n, 0        --&gt; Int:D )
	is equiv(&amp;infix:&lt;↑↑&gt;)
	is assoc&lt;right&gt; { 1 }
multi infix:&lt;↑²&gt; ( Int:D \n, 1        --&gt; Int:D )
	is equiv(&amp;infix:&lt;↑↑&gt;)
	is assoc&lt;right&gt; { n }
multi infix:&lt;↑²&gt; ( Int:D \n, Int:D \m --&gt; Int:D )
	is equiv(&amp;infix:&lt;↑↑&gt;)
	is assoc&lt;right&gt; { [↑] n xx m }
</pre>

You get the idea. I&#39;ve made a much longer <a href="https://gist.github.com/briandfoy/b85de0526e3a747c15376a3d33629f28">demonstration program</a> that&#39;s in a gist.

		<description><![CDATA[The <i>META6.json</i> file has metadata for a Perl 6 module. But I like to also put things in the module file. I&#39;d rather have some of that stuff with the code in case the metadata file goes missing as it might if you throw a <i>.pm</i> file in a directory rather than installing with <code>zef</code>. That means I forget to update one of them (it&#39;s usually the <i>META6.json</i>). <!--more-->

I created a test file to check that the versions in <i>META6.json</i>. I&#39;d been meaning to do this since I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/44883887/2766176">asked about it on Stackoverflow</a> a long time ago:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

use Test;
use META6;

use File::Find;
constant package-name = &#39;File::Find&#39;;

my $module-version = File::Find.^ver;
ok $module-version.defined, &#39;Module specifies a version&#39;;
diag &quot;Module version is $module-version&quot;;

my $meta-file = &#39;META6.json&#39;;
my $meta = META6.new: file =&gt; $meta-file;

my $meta-version = $meta.version;
ok $meta-version.defined, &#39;META6 specifies a version&#39;;
diag &quot;META6 version is $meta-version&quot;;

is $meta-version, $module-version, &#39;META6 version matches module version&#39;;

done-testing();
</pre>

The obvious next step is to make a program to update <i>META6.json</i> for me but so far this way is a lot less work. I have no plans to make this a module but someone else can if they like.

		<description><![CDATA[Every so often I notice that my iTunes library has a lot of duplicate items and I need to get rid of things. It&#39;s mostly a task for finding an audio file that has the same name as another audio file but with a space and digit added right before the extension. <i>Song.mp3</i> and <i>Song 1.mp3</i> are examples of this problem. They&#39;ll be in the same directory; duplicates in different directories are a different matter and I&#39;ve done that too by comparing file digests. That&#39;s not this problem.

Here&#39;s what I did. It&#39;s not pretty because I didn&#39;t care to make it so. It&#39;s not exciting because I wasn&#39;t researching anything or exploring an idea. It&#39;s just getting rid of files. I solved the problem and moved on. 

I develop these little tools incrementally. Can I get all the files? Can I find the files that have the name without the space and digit. I program a step and check the result. Then I add the next step. The process drives the procedural structure. 

And during this process I forked then completely rewrote a <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find">File::Find</a> module. You don&#39;t need my version for this though. The one <code>zef install File::Find</code> gives you should be fine.

A few quick notes:

<ul>
<li>I really like the <code>#`( ... )</code> comments
</li><li>An array interpolated into a pattern is an alternation of the elements
</li><li><code>.IO</code> objects know how to make or tear apart paths.
</li></ul>

<pre class="brush:plain">
#!/Applications/Rakudo/bin/perl6

use File::Find:auth&lt;bdfoy&gt;; # https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find

#`( iTunes loves screwing up files. I get a file imported multiple
times instead of realizing it&#39;s already in there.

	some song.mp3
	some song 1.mp3

Let&#39;s find these pairs where the names differ by the addition of
a space and a single digit (although I&#39;ve had problems like this with
as high as 4.
)
my $dir = &#39;/Users/brian/Dropbox/iTunes/Music&#39;;
my $target = &#39;/Users/brian/BackupMusic&#39;;

#`(
I actually used this module to count extensions and these are the
one I want to focus on. An array in a regex is an alternation.
)
my @extensions = &lt;mp3 m4a=&quot;&quot; m4p=&quot;&quot;&gt;;
my $sequence := find(
	dir  =&gt; $dir,
	name =&gt; / \h &#39;1&#39; &#39;.&#39; @extensions $ /,
	);

my $count = 0;
my $dry-run = True; # try it before we move any files
for $sequence -&gt; $file {

	#`(
	other = the file of the same name without a numbered copy
	if that file doesn&#39;t exist we don&#39;t have a problem
	)
	my $other = $file.subst:
		/ \h &#39;1&#39; &#39;.&#39; (@extensions) $ /,
		&quot;.$0&quot;;
	my $exists = $other.IO.e;
	next unless $exists;
	$count++;

	put &#39;-&#39; x 50;
	put &quot;file: $file&quot;;
	put &quot;other: $other ($exists)&quot;;

	#`(
	We need the part after the starting directory because we&#39;ll add
	that to the new target directory. We might have to make a subdir
	tree
	)
	my $rel = $file.IO.relative: $dir;

	my $new = $rel.IO.absolute: $target;
	my $new-dir = $new.IO.parent.IO;
	$new-dir.mkdir unless $new-dir.e;
	$other.IO.rename( $new ) unless $dry-run;
	}

say &quot;Found $count files&quot;;
</pre>

Here&#39;s the program I used to survey the file extensions I used to populate <code>@extensions</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use File::Find:auth&lt;BDFOY&gt;; # https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-file-find
use PrettyDump; 

my $list := find( dir =&gt; $*HOME.child( &#39;Dropbox/iTunes/Music&#39; ) );

my %extensions;
for $list -&gt; $item {
	next if $item.d;
	%extensions{ $item.extension }++
	}

pd %extensions;
</pre>

And here&#39;s what I had done the last time I had this problem. It&#39;s Perl 5 interpreting the results of an external <code>find</code>. I think last time I ended up throwing an <code>unlink</code> in there at some point:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v5.14;
open my $fh, &#39;find . -name &quot;* [1234].m[p4][ap3]&quot; |&#39;;

while( <$fh> ) {
	chomp;
	my $other = s/\s+(\d+)(?=\.[^.]+\z)//r;
	next unless -e $other;
	print &quot;$_\n\t$other\n&quot;;
	}

close $fh or die &quot;Error in Find!&quot;
</$fh></pre>

I&#39;ll probably lose my Perl 6 program, forget I wrote this, and recreate this in nine months. I might even post about it again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While playing with some strings I realized that I really wanted strings to do the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Positional">Positional</a> role. When I&#39;m inspecting or modifying strings I&#39;m often doing things based on positions so the <code>Positional</code> interface seems interesting. Just for fun I can adapt the <code>[ ]</code> to be the interface to <code>substr</code>: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
multi postcircumfix:<[ ]> ( Str:D $s, Int:D $n --&gt; Str ) {
	$s.substr: $n, 1

multi postcircumfix:<[ ]> ( Str:D $s, Range:D $r --&gt; Str ) {
	$s.substr: $r.min, $r.max - $r.min + 1
	}
multi postcircumfix:<[ ]> ( Str:D $s, List:D $i --&gt; List ) {

my $string = &#39;The quick, purple butterfly&#39;;

{ # Works
my $single = $string[0];
say $single;

{ # Works
my $substring = $string[5..9];
say $substring;
}

{ # Works
my $substring = $string[1,3,5,7];
say $substring;

</[></[></[></pre>

This outputs:

<div class="image center">

</div>
</div>

In my test file I add a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/phasers#CONTROL">CONTROL phaser</a>. This catches the action of block exiting things including <code>return</code>, <code>fail</code>, <code>redo</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>take</code>, and in this case, <code>warn</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
{ # with forced find to Not work recursive
CONTROL {
	my $label = &#39;:recursive warns about deprecation&#39;;
	when CX::Warn { like $_.message, /deprecated/, $label; }
	default       { fail( $label ); }
	}
my $res = find(:dir&lt;t/dir1&gt;, :name&lt;file.bar&gt;, recursive =&gt; False);
is $res.elems, 1, &#39;name with a string&#39;;
}
</pre>

You won&#39;t catch these in a normal <code>CATCH</code> block:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub foow { warn &quot;This is a warning&quot; }
sub food { die  &quot;This is a death&quot; }

{
CONTROL {
	when CX::Warn { put &quot;Caught warning in CONTROL&quot; }
	}
foow();
}


try {
CATCH {
	when CX::Warn  { put &quot;Caught warning in CATCH&quot; }
	when  X::AdHoc { put &quot;Caught death in CATCH&quot; }
	default { put &quot;Caught {$_.^name} with {$_.message}&quot; }
	}
foow();
food();
}
</pre>

The output shows that the <code>CONTROL</code> caught the warning from the first call but the <code>CATCH</code> let it pass through in the second:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Caught warning in CONTROL
Caught death in CATCH
This is a warning
  in sub foow at /Users/brian/Desktop/test.p6 line 5

		<description><![CDATA[Turning numbers into strings can be a big waste of time and money.  Paul Khuong wrote about this in <a href="//www.pvk.ca/Blog/2017/12/22/appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/">How to Print Integers Really Fast (With Open Source AppNexus Code!)</a>. If you&#39;ve bought into the JSON mania you&#39;re probably serializing numbers as strings quite a bit without even thinking about it. Much of his discussion is special to C or C++ where you (think) you directly control the hardware. Since this is also a typical interview problem I thought I&#39;d work on it in Perl 6 with a few extras. <!--more-->

The solutions I found convert everything to decimal numbers. There are probably some hexadecimal converters out there. That&#39;s not so interesting. How about a converter for arbitrary bases with arbitrary digits? And, I can&#39;t use any of the builtin stuff to make this work (and so far I haven&#39;t peeked to see how Rakudo does it).

The solution is to decompose a number into parts and convert that  partto a string with a lookup table. Put together all your string parts to get the full number. Optimizing that lookup table is most of the problem but I don&#39;t worry about that right away.

I create a factory that takes a single string where each character represents a digit; the number of digits is the base. I don&#39;t care which characters are in the string. Maybe they aren&#39;t in order of their codepoints, or they are repeated, or some other weird thing. Specify a stupid string and get stupid number serializations. If I don&#39;t specify a string I&#39;ll default to the decimal digits. From that I get the base that I&#39;ll use to decompose the number and I&#39;ll break up the string into characters in an array so I can use the numeric value as the index to map it onto its string value. I&#39;ll collect the string values then join them:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub int-to-str-factory (
		Str:D $digit-str = &#39;0123456789&#39;
		--&gt; Callable:D ) {
	my Int:D $base  = $digit-str.chars;
	my Str:D @table = $digit-str.comb;

	sub ( Int:D $i is copy where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Str:D ) {
		my Str:D @temp = ();

		return @table.[0] if $i == 0;

		while $i &gt; 0 {
			my Int:D $digit = $i % $base;
			$i div= $base;
			@temp.unshift: @table.[ $digit ];
			}

		@temp.join: &#39;&#39;;
		}
	}
</pre>

This doesn&#39;t convert numbers to strings. It creates code that converts numbers to strings and returns that anonymous subroutine. That&#39;s what a factory does. I&#39;ve also limited this to zero and positive integers but handling sign is not a big deal if I need it.

The <code>div</code> operator for integer division is quite a handy complement to the <code>%</code> modulus to get the remainder. I thought briefly about defining my own operator to return the remainder and reduce the starting number in one step, but maybe I&#39;ll come back to that in some other post.

If I were doing this in C++ I&#39;d care about that because the bits in physical storage probably care about them. The original posts were using binary-coded decimal that used four bits per digit. Add the same nybble to each of those and you get the ASCII character for that digit. Clever. Since Perl 6 doesn&#39;t let me look at the physical representation I can skip that part of the problem (although I could connect to external libraries). That also means that I don&#39;t have to allocate any memory for my final string. I don&#39;t get to make those choices although the C++ program thinks hard about that.

Now I can create something to turn numbers into decimal strings:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $decimal-stringifier = int-to-str-factory();
put $decimal-stringifier.( 0xDEADBEEF );
</pre>

Remember that my use of a literal hexadecimal number there is a red herring. The parser converts that into an internal integer and doesn&#39;t care how it started. I&#39;m converting internal numbers to strings.

So let&#39;s make some fancy strings. I&#39;ll make a hash with labels for the representation as keys and their code as the value (<a href="//gist.github.com/briandfoy/b648b4c88580d18ecc789b3e3e966c61">it&#39;s all in a gist</a>), but that might diverge from the code in this article):

<pre class="brush:plain">
#`(
Create a bunch of anonymous subroutines to create different representations of an integer. The label is the key of the 
hash and the sub is the value.
)
my %representations = map { $_.[0] =&gt; int-to-str-factory( $_.[1] ) }, (
	( &#39;Decimal&#39;,&#39;0123456789&#39; ),
	( &#39;Binary&#39;, &#39;👎👍&#39; ),
	( &#39;Base3&#39;, &#39;012&#39; ),
	( &#39;Octal&#39;, &#39;01234567&#39; ),
	( &#39;Hex&#39;, &#39;0123456789abcdef&#39; ),
	( &#39;Base36&#39;, &#39;0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#39; ),
	( &#39;Braille&#39;, &#39;⠁⠃⠉⠙⠑⠋⠛⠓⠊⠚&#39; ),
	( &#39;Arabic&#39;, @(
		&#39;ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO&#39;.parse-names
				..
		&#39;ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT NINE&#39;.parse-names
		).join: &#39;&#39; ),
	);


sub MAIN ( Int:D $n = 100_000_000.rand.Int ) {
	put &quot;number is $n&quot;;

	for %representations.kv -&gt; $label, $sub {
		put &quot;$label: &quot;, $sub.( $n );
		}
	}
</pre>

Here&#39;s a run of that:

As I mentioned earlier I don&#39;t get to think as hard in Perl 6 as C++. I&#39;m much farther away from the iron so choosing registers wisely and other things that hardware cares about. Andrei Alexandrescu writes about this in <a href="//www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/three-optimization-tips-for-c/10151361643253920">Three Optimization Tips for C++</a> where he solves the same problem.

Part of these C++ solutions involve decomposing the number into larger chunks (powers of the base) and translating chunks with a longer lookup table. In C++ they wanted to minimize division operations, which probably makes less sense in a much higher level language like Perl 6. Instead of decomposing 8936 into 8, 9, 3, 6 I can decompose it into 89 and 36 and translate those numbers directly without more math. There&#39;s a trick; if I break up the number 1307 into 13 and 07, I can&#39;t translate 07 to 7. That zero needs to stay there.

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub int-to-str-factory (
		Str:D $digit-str = &#39;0123456789&#39;
		--&gt; Callable:D ) {
	my Int:D $base   = $digit-str.chars;
	my Int:D $base2  = $base ** 2;

	# expand lookup to all one digit strings. These don&#39;t
	# have leading zeros
	my Str:D @digits = $digit-str.comb;

	# expand lookup to all two digit strings
	# leading zeros matter!
	my Str:D @digits2 = @digits X~ @digits;

	sub ( Int:D $i is copy where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Str:D ) {
		my Str:D @temp = ();

		return @digits.[0] if $i == 0;

		while $i &gt; 0 {
			if $i &gt;= $base2 {
				my Int:D $digit = $i % $base2;
				@temp.unshift: @digits2.[ $digit ];
				$i div= $base2
				}
			else {
				my Int:D $digit = $i % $base;
				@temp.unshift: @digits.[ $digit ];
				$i div= $base
				}
			}

		return @temp.join: &#39;&#39;;
		}
	}
</pre>

How big that lookup table is depends on many things including the typical size of your numbers. A smaller table requires you to do more divisions but a larger table might involve more searching. I used an array but I could have used a hash. No optimization is probably best for any situation. You have to know something about your numbers. If you always have numbers that take up all 256 bits (a SHA perhaps) you have a different optimization than numbers mostly under 100.

But now here&#39;s another thing I can do. I can break up a really big number into much larger chunks and provide those smaller numbers as a sequence. I then format those separately (perhaps in parallel) by calling <code>.hyper</code> on that sequence. The <code>.hyper</code> allows parallelism (where available) and keeps everything in order (unlike <code>.race</code> which doesn&#39;t). I reässemble the chunks at the end.

The <code>big-chunks-sequence</code> sequences makes the smaller numbers and I&#39;ve moved the factories into a module to get them out of the way (<a href="//gist.github.com/briandfoy/bc5b47efb30af6d84135a91bd5c44b2e">gist</a>).

		<description><![CDATA[I implemented Heap&#39;s algorithm, which generates all permutations of a list, in Perl 6. It&#39;s the end of the year and I&#39;m cleaning out all the things I marked to read later. Sometimes I&#39;ll take something simple, such as a famous algorithm, and try to do it on my own. It&#39;s good practice for language skills but it&#39;s also a good education on languages. <!--more-->

I was reading David M.Bradford&#39;s <a href="http://tinypig2.blogspot.co.za/2016/12/heaps-algorithm-and-generating-perl.html">Heap&#39;s Algorithm and Generating Perl Code From Pseudocode</a>, which referenced the Wikipedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap&#39;s_algorithm">Heap&#39;s Algorithm</a>.

There&#39;s already a method that does this, but I&#39;m not going to let that stand in my way:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my @array = &lt;a b c&gt;
[a b c]
&gt; @array.permutations
((a b c) (a c b) (b a c) (b c a) (c a b) (c b a))
</pre>

The structure of my solution is mostly the same (<i>mutatis mutandi</i>) that I&#39;d read on either of those pages:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @array = &lt;a b c&gt;;

for heaps-algorithm( @array, ) -&gt; $permutation {
	put $permutation;
	}

sub heaps-algorithm ( *@array ) {
	state $i = 0;
	state @permutations = [ @array.clone, ];
	state @A = |@permutations.[0].clone;
	state @c = (0) xx @A.elems;

	loop {
		if @c[$i] &lt; $i {
			my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
			@A[$swap-index, $i] = @A[$i, $swap-index];
			@permutations.push: @A.clone;
			@c[$i]++;
			$i = 0;
			}
		else {
			@c[$i] = 0;
			$i++;
			}
		
		last unless $i &lt; @array.elems;
		}

	return @permutations;
	}
</pre>

There are a few interesting bits of Perl 6 syntax. It&#39;s the end of the year and I have many other things to use or lose so I&#39;ll merely point out a few things:

<h3>The single argument rule</h3>

I wanted to build up an array of permutations. For the first item I store the original array. I have a significant trailing comma there:

<pre class="brush:plain">
	state @permutations = [ @array.clone, ];
</pre>

If I only use a single array argument (the single argument), the array is automatically flattened. The comma means that it&#39;s not a single argument even though there isn&#39;t a second argument. That isn&#39;t flattened. Notice the extra structure:

<pre class="brush:perl">
% perl 6
&gt; my @array = &lt;a b c&gt;
[a b c]
&gt; my @p = [ @array ]
[a b c]
&gt; my @p = [ @array, ]
[[a b c]]
</pre> 

When I initialize <code>@A</code>, which is the structure that I want to change, I flatten the first element with the <code>|</code>. 

<h3>In-place swapping</h3>

Many other places I looked followed the pseudocode that checked the cursor and then called one of two swap operations:

<pre class="brush:perl">
			if i is even then
				swap(A[0], A[i])
			else
				swap(A[c[i]], A[i])
			end if
</pre> 

I&#39;ll choose the right index and put that into the slices:

<pre class="brush:perl">
			my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
			@A[$swap-index, $i] = @A[$i, $swap-index];
</pre> 

<h3>Cloning</h3>

Each time I create a new permutation I add it to <code>@permutations</code>. But, I don&#39;t want to keep adding the same object because that object will keep moving it&#39;s elements around. I want to preserve the order each time so I call <code>clone</code>. I probably overuse that method.

<pre class="brush:perl">
@permutations.push: @A.clone;
</pre> 

I could have done something different, such as using <code>.List</code> to make a new list out of the current state of the array. I wasn&#39;t thinking too hard about what I wanted on the other side but it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;d want something mutable.

<pre class="brush:perl">
@permutations.push: @A.List;
</pre> 

<h2>Make it a sequence, part 1</h2>

The solution that I translated created all the permutations. That&#39;s okay for small lists but not so good for bigger ones. Perl 6 has user-defined sequences. These are lazy and don&#39;t create the next item until it needs to. Could I make this a sequence using the <code>...</code> operator? Mostly I&#39;m doing this to see if it would work because I&#39;ve been playing with other weird sequences. I certainly don&#39;t encourage this.

I can use a code reference to decide the next thingy. If that code reference takes arguments, it gets that number of the prior elements in the sequence. I&#39;d like to get the first element to initialize the <code>@A</code>. After that I just ignore the argument.

I have to adjust the code a bit to end with the right thing. I can&#39;t <code>return</code> because this is not a routine. It&#39;s just a <code>Block</code>. I&#39;ll use <code>$next</code> for that.

I don&#39;t particularly like my solution but this is where I ran out of steam:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $array = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

my $code-ref = -&gt; ( *@a ) { 
	state $i = 0;
	state @A = @a.clone;
	state @c = (0) xx @A.elems;

	my $next;
	
	loop {
		if @c[$i] &lt; $i {
			my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
			@A[$swap-index, $i] = @A[$i, $swap-index];
			$next = @A.clone;
			@c[$i]++;
			$i = 0;
			last;
			}
		else {
			@c[$i] = 0;
			$i++;
			}

		last unless $i &lt; @A.elems; 
		}

	$next;
	}

sub make-sequence ( $a --&gt; Seq ) { $a, $code-ref ...^ !*.defined }

my $seq = make-sequence( $array );

for @$seq -&gt; $next { 
	put $next;
	}
</pre>

<h2>Make it a sequence, part 2</h2>

The <code>...</code> worked but is pretty ugly. As Michael mentioned in the comments I should have used <code>gather</code> for this. This generates a <code>Seq</code> (similar to Python&#39;s <code>yield</code>). The <code>gather</code> block is the sequence and every <code>take</code> can generate one or more elements for the sequence. The code only runs to the point that it gets another element; when you want another element the code resumes where it left off. If the code finishes without encountering another <code>take</code> (like when this <code>while</code> is done) the sequence is exhausted:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub heaps-sequence ( *@a --&gt; Seq:D ) {
	gather {
		state $i = 0;
		state @c = (0) xx @a.elems;
		take @a.List;

		while $i &lt;  @a.elems {
			if @c[$i] &lt; $i {
				my $swap-index = $i %% 2 ?? 0 !! @c[$i];
				@a[$swap-index, $i] = @a[$i, $swap-index];
				take @a.List;
				@c[$i]++;
				$i = 0;
				}
			else {
				@c[$i] = 0;
				$i++
				}
			}
		}
	}

my $seq = heaps-sequence( <1 2 3> );

for @$seq -&gt; $next {
	put $next;
	last if $next &gt; 10;
	}

I was playing around with a <a href="http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2017/06/19/counterintuitive-problem-everyone-room-keeps-giving-dollars-random-others-youll-never-guess-happens-next/">simulation problem from Uri Wilensky</a> (R&#39;s <code>gganimate</code> is pretty cool, and pretty and cool). 

That&#39;s the same thing as writing out both sides:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$giver&lt;wallet given&gt; = $giver&lt;wallet given&gt; Z+ ( -$amount, $amount )
</pre>

But, I also could have used a hyper here:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$giver&lt;wallet given&gt; &gt;&gt;+=&lt;&lt; ( -$amount, $amount )
</pre>

I&#39;ve longed wished for this sort of thing in Perl 5, and I think I&#39;ve strained various unmaintainable kludges to get it. Even these Perl 6 expressions might be too mind bending for the work-a-day maintainer.

And, for what it&#39;s worth, the results are pretty much what I expected despite the those Ph.D.s guessing incorrectly.

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 averages &quot;floating point&quot; numbers correctly. That&#39;s an interesting statement because it seems like it should be obvious and expected. However, people around computers long enough are used to round-off error. Sinan Ünür wrote <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2015/03/how-you-average-numbers.html">How you average numbers matters</a> to show the curious compounding of small effects. He shows some Perl 5 code:

<!--more-->

<pre class="brush:perl">
my @data = (1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) x 50_000;
printf &quot;Naive mean:                  %f\n&quot;, (sum @data) / @data;
</pre>

This outputs the wrong answer instead of 500,000,000.6:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Naive mean:                  500000000.600916
</pre>

I wanted to try this in Perl 6 and had been putting it off thinking I might have to do a work to see what&#39;s going on.

<pre class="brush:perl">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 50_000;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @data) / @data.elems;
</pre>

But no, Perl 6 give the right answer:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
</pre>

You can expand the example to show the identity of the first object in the list. The <code>.^name</code> meta method will tell you that:

<pre class="brush:perl">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 50_000;
put @data[0].^name;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @data) / @data.elems;
</pre>

You see that the first thing (and all the other things) is a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a>, Perl 6&#39;s builtin rational number type:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Rat
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
</pre>

Perl 6 stored the number as a ratio instead of a floating point number. It stays as an exact value. You can add a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> and another <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> and get another exact value in the resultant <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a>. You can keep doing that almost as long as you like as long as Perl 6 can represent the numerator and denominator (and it reduces the fraction as it goes along). Beyond that there&#39;s a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/FatRat">FatRat</a> that can take you even further.

You can sort it ascending or descending, like Sinan did. In his examples, each order got a different answer in the end. You can try that in the Perl 6 version:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 5;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @data) / @data.elems;

my @asc  = @data.sort: &amp;infix:«<=>»;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @asc) / @asc.elems;

my @desc = @asc.reverse;
printf &quot;Naive mean: %f\n&quot;, ([+] @desc) / @desc.elems;
</=></pre>

But, every mean gives the same answer:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
Naive mean: 500000000.600000
</pre>

So, there&#39;s nothing to see here. At least it&#39;s off my to-do list. Many of the things Sinan sends me requires long reads and working out math by hand, but this was easy.

You can still have some small effects in the final operation to turn the rational number into a floating point, but that&#39;s something unrelated to the averaging.

<hr>

There are a few other interesting things in the simple code which I&#39;ll cover quickly:

The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/reduce">reduction operator</a>, <code>[+]</code> is a quick way to type that you want to apply that operation between every item in the list. You don&#39;t have to use the addition operator. You can put almost anything in there.

<hr>

The <code>xx</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/xx">list repetition operator</a>. But, I want each list to combine into a flatten larger list. The <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Slip#sub_slip">slip</a></code> causes an inner list to lose its list structure and become separate items in the larger list. Without the <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Slip#sub_slip">slip</a></code> you&#39;d get a list of 50,000 sublists. Try it with only five sublists:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @data = (1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 5;
say @data;
</pre>

The <code>@data</code> array has five items, all of which are lists:

<pre class="brush:plain">
[(1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1) (1000000000.1 1.1)]
</pre>

Now add the <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Slip#sub_slip">slip</a></code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @data = slip(1_000_000_000.1, 1.1) xx 5;
say @data;
</pre>

The array now has is flat. The sublist inserted their items into the larger list without the structure:

<pre class="brush:plain">
[1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1 1000000000.1 1.1]
</pre>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#39;t actually mean that you shouldn&#39;t use <code>&lt;</code>, but I&#39;m playing off <a href="http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.hu/2016/02/dont-use-greater-than-sign-in.html">Don&#39;t use the greater than sign in programming</a>. That post from Lewellyn Falco reminded me of a trick for a conditional that checks if a number is inside or outside of a range. A C programmer pointed this out to me years and years ago. It&#39;s not an uncommon trick, but it&#39;s not one I think about much. And, in Perl 6, there&#39;s another way to do the same thing.

<!--more-->

To convey intent, he constructed his comparisons so both uses of the variable were either on the inside or on the outside. That way, the position of the variable in the comparisons showed where he intended its value to be. Here&#39;s that expressed in C:
<pre class="brush:c">/* x between 5 and 10 */
if( 5 &lt; x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10 ) { ... }

/* x not between 5 and 10 */
if( x &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; 10 &lt;= x ) { ... }
</pre>
The lowest value is left-most and the greatest value is right-most. Those might be literals or variables. For this to work, the comparators have to be the same. Flip one of them and it might never work because the combined conditions don&#39;t mean what they superficially appear to mean:
<pre class="brush:c">if( 5 &lt; x &amp;&amp; 10 &lt; x ) { ... }  /* Just x &gt; 10 really */
</pre>
Even with this trick of placing the variable in the literal code, thi still annoys me because I have to specify the variable twice.

Python 2 lets you do it with a <i>chained comparison</i>:
<pre class="brush:python">#!/usr/bin/python

x = 6

if 5 &lt; x &lt; 10 :
	print &quot;It&#39;s between 5 and 10&quot;
else:
	print &quot;It&#39;s outside the range&quot;
</pre>
Python didn&#39;t invent this feature. <a href="http://rigaux.org/language-study/concepts-history.html">Various resources that credit BCPL curiously link to a Perl 6 RFC</a>. Odd. I think they are all pulling from the same source. You can do it in Ruby if you <a href="https://gist.github.com/padde/2429814">redefine some operators</a>. CoffeeScript has it. Other languages have it.

But, this is a blog about Perl 6, which can do this too. This is one of the more pleasing small changes that I really like:
<pre class="brush:plain">my $x = 6;

if 5 &lt; $x &lt; 10 {
	put &quot;x is between 5 and 10&quot;;
	}
else {
	put &quot;x is not in range&quot;;
	}
</pre>
But, Perl 6 goes one better. If you want to test that something is within a range, test that it&#39;s in a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Range">Range</a>. To exclude the endpoints, you need the <code>^</code> characters around the <code>..</code>:
<pre class="brush:plain">if $x ~~ 5^..^10 {
	put &quot;x is between 5 and 10&quot;;
	}
else {
	put &quot;x is not in range&quot;;
	}
</pre>
This comparison really is the same thing. Instead of checking that <code>$x</code> is in the set <i>6,7,8,9</i> (as you might expect from turning the Range into a list) it tests that the value of <code>$x</code> as a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Real">Real</a> is between the endpoints. So, 5.5 and 9.999 are within that Range. That&#39;s the same behavior as the previous examples.

Perl 6 doesn&#39;t stop there. You can make the chain as long as you like:
<pre class="brush:plain">if 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7 {
	say &quot;That&#39;s a long chain!&quot;;
	}
</pre>
But, you don&#39;t need the chain. The <a href="/2020/03/17/reducing-comparison-operators/">reduction operator works with the comparison operators too</a>:
<pre class="brush:plain">if [&lt;] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 {
	say &quot;That&#39;s a not long chain!&quot;;
	}
</pre>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rakudo is now easier to install on Windows. <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/rakudostar">Rakudo Star is now in Chocolatey</a> (with 2017.04 awaiting moderation as I write this). This makes it much easier to automatically deploy Rakudo Star in Windows environments.

Earlier this month I spent too much time getting <a href="/2017/04/02/rakudo-star-on-appveyor/">Rakudo to install on AppVeyor</a>, and, having spent too much time on that, I spent a bunch more getting co-maintainer permissions on the chocolatey package. I updated the original package created by Jake Russo back in 2015, including all the new chocolatey requirements. I have all of that in GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/rakudo-star-chocolatey">rakudo-star-chocolatey</a>. After the semi-manual approval process, I have a fresh Rakudo available. Two days later 2017.04 came out. I&#39;ve updated the package again and it&#39;s in moderation (should clear in a couple days).

Using a package manager that other services already support makes it a cinch to deploy Rakudo there. For example, Windows 10 has <a href="https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/blob/master/readme.md">OneGet</a>, a manager of package managers. You can install several package manager and ask OneGet to install something. Somehow it figures out who can provide it and does the magic:

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="369" src="/images/oneget-powershell.png" style="border:1" width="500">
</div>
</div>

That looks complicated, but it&#39;s really two commands with some confirmations:

<pre class="brush:plain">
PS C:\&gt; Get-PackageProvider -name chocolatey

PS C:\&gt; Install-Package rakudostar
</pre>

You probably have to answer a couple of questions in this process. The rakudostar package isn&#39;t trusted, but the chocolatey package has the SHA256 of the MSI from <a href="http://rakudo.org/">rakudo.org</a>. But, chocolatey also trusts me to use the right URL. I could put anything in there. I&#39;ll have to work on the trusted part some other time (unless you want to figure it out).

Now my AppVeyor config in the <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test"> perl6_appveyor_test</a> test project is now much simpler. The Rakudo installation is a couple of lines instead of the tricky PowerShell I had before:

<pre class="plain">
  - if not exist &quot;C:\Rakudo&quot; cinst rakudostar
  - SET PATH=C:\rakudo\bin;C:\rakudo\share\perl6\site\bin;%PATH%
  - ps: refreshenv
  - perl6 -v

I was playing with arbitrary precision rational numbers in Perl 6, irrationally perhaps by playing with the natural base, <i>e</i>, also known as Euler&#39;s Number. That&#39;s a builtin value in Perl 6 but with limited precision (that&#39;s probably good enough for most people): <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; e
2.71828182845905
</pre>

I want more digits so I calculate them myself. One approximation of <i>e</i> is an infinite series:

$$
e = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}
$$

I can turn that into Perl 6 as a program that specifies the number of digits past the decimal place I&#39;d like to calculate. In this code, you don&#39;t see a factorial explicitly. There&#39;s no need for a function (recursive or otherwise) because I can keep the result of the factorial in one iteration for the next:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub MAIN ( Int $precision = 30 ) {
	loop {
		state $sum       = FatRat.new( 0, 1 );

		# the term in the sequence
		state $i         = 0;

		# The factorial, remembered for the next iteration
		state $last      = 1;

		$sum += FatRat.new( 1, $last );
		$last *= ++$i;

		put &quot;$i: ({$sum.nude})\n\t   &quot; ~ $sum;
		last if $sum.Str.chars &gt; $precision + 2; # +2 for the 2 and the .
		}
	}
</pre>

I use the <code>.nude</code> method to get the numerator and denominator of the fraction that Perl 6 tracks. I output that with the iteration number. Under that, I output part of the stringified version of the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/FatRat">FatRat</a>:

</pre>

Look at iterations 19 and 20. Each iteration should make the approximation larger because it only adds a positive value to the previous value. But, the value goes from 2.71828182845904523 to the slightly less 2.718281828459045. This isn&#39;t a rounding error because one is two digits shorter:

<pre class="brush:plain">
19: (17403456103284421 6402373705728000)
	   2.71828182845904523
20: (82666416490601 30411275102208)
	   2.718281828459045
</pre>

Notice what happened to the fraction in iteration 20. There are fewer digits in the denominator for that iteration. Perl 6 uses the number of digits in the denominator to decide how many digits to put into the stringification. You can see this in the <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Rational.pm">Rational.Str method in Rakudo</a>. It&#39;s a minimum of 6 digits, but otherwise one more than the number of denominator digits.

But, the fraction can change. Perl 6 normalizes that numerator and denominator to be co-prime. They share no common factors. This normalization is still the same number. If I make a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> with 2 and 4, Perl 6 reduces that to 1 and 2:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type &#39;exit&#39; or &#39;^D&#39;
&gt; Rat.new( 2, 4 )
0.5
&gt; Rat.new( 2, 4 ).nude
(1 2)
</pre>

When this happens in my Euler example, some iterations seem to backtrack in digits because of the digit length of the normalized fraction. No big whoop.

There&#39;s another way to write this program, though. Often we do these sorts of things because we pretend that we don&#39;t already know the answers. I could simply put the answer in the program and output the parts of it that I want. Maybe I don&#39;t need 10,000 digits but they are there if I want them:

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.plover.com/math/24-puzzle.html">Mark Jason Dominus solved the 24 Puzzle in Perl</a>, then explicated some non-Perl solutions other people sent him. <a href="https://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/2102">RJBS tried it in Forth</a>. I&#39;ve been meaning to try it in Perl 6. I bumbled around as I stubbornly tried to include language features I didn&#39;t really need, but that&#39;s part of the fun. <!--more-->

<a href="http://blog.plover.com/math/17-puzzle.html">Here&#39;s the problem</a>:

<blockquote>
Given 6,6,5,2, make 17 using the operators +, -, *, and /.
</blockquote>

The trick with these puzzles is to not read mjd&#39;s solution before struggling with it yourself. Also, I wanted to do this with Perl 6 features that I wouldn&#39;t be able to use in Perl or C. If the program looks the same in a different language, who cares? It&#39;s done. A mere translation is not that interesting.

I started with the idea that I wanted to use the cross and hyper operations to make the lists of things I&#39;d want to process, and I wanted to use a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Channel">Channel</a> to hold the list of candidate solutions that various <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Promise">Promises</a> would try to solve. Something would fill the channel, and a set of promises running in other threads would grab candidates. Perl 6 has asynchronous support builtin and I wanted to play with that.

I want my program&#39;s invocation to take a list of numbers where the last number was the goal:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 24-problems.p6 [digits] [goal]
</pre>

To solve this problem, I&#39;d run it as:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 24-problems.p6 6 6 5 2 17
</pre>

Here&#39;s my solution, which is still a bit messy. For any list of <i>N</i> digits, I need <i>N - 1</i> operators to insert between the digits. I use the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_X">cross operator</a> in the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Reduction_Operators">reduction operator</a>, <code>[X]</code>, with a list of <i>N - 1</i> copies of <code>@operations</code>. That <code>xx</code> operator is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/xx">list replication operator</a>. That&#39;s a lot of work for a single statement (and isn&#39;t that great?).

Ignore the middle of <code>MAIN</code> for a moment. In that <code>for</code> loop I cross all the permutations of digits with all the combinations of the operators. These are all of the candidate solutions. I end up with a bunch of two element lists; the first element is the digits in some order and the second is the list of operators. Perl 6 maintains that structure, so I send a two element thing into the channel.

Now, back up. I have another <code>for</code> that creates a bunch of promises with <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/start"><code>start</code>. These will run in separate threads in the background. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/concurrency#index-entry-whenever"><code>whenever</code></a> in <code>react</code> grabs an item from the channel and does some work. An item in a channel is guaranteed to be handled only once so the promises do their work then fight it out to get another candidate to try.

So, this has the Perl 6 structure I want:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub MAIN (*@) {
	my $goal       = @*ARGS.pop;
	my @numbers    = @*ARGS.clone.flat;
	my @operations = <+ * -></+>;

	# I need N - 1 operators, with repeats (so, + + + is fine)
	my @cross = [X] @operations xx (@numbers.elems - 1);
	my @perms = @numbers.permutations.unique( :with(&amp;[eqv]) );

	put &quot;Total candidates: &quot; ~ ( @cross.elems * @perms.elems );

	my $channel = Channel.new;

	my @p;
	my $total = 0;
	for 1 .. 1 {
		@p.push: start {
			react  {
				whenever $channel -&gt; $item {
					state $count = 0; $count++;
					my $result = evaluate( $item );
					put &quot;SOLUTION! $result[*-1] = $goal&quot; if $result[0] == $goal;
					LAST {
						$total += $count;
						put &quot;Thread {$*THREAD.id} handled $count candidates&quot;
						}
					}
				}
			};
		}

	my $start = now;
	put &quot;Starting to send to channels&quot;;
	for @perms X @cross -&gt; $i {
		$channel.send( $i )
		}
	put &quot;Done sending to channels: &quot; ~ (now - $start) ~ &quot; seconds&quot;;

	$channel.close;

	await |@p;

	put &quot;Total handled was $total&quot;;
	}

sub evaluate ( $item ) {
	my @digits  = $item[0].flat;
	my @ops     = $item[1].flat;

	my @ops2 = ( |@ops, &#39;&#39; );

	my $string = @digits &gt;&gt;~&lt;<@ops2; @ops.elems while> 0 {
		splice(
			@digits, 0, 2,
			op( @ops.shift, |@digits[0,1] )
			);
		}

	return [ @digits[0], $string ];
	}

multi op ( &#39;+&#39;, $m, $n ) { $m + $n }
multi op ( &#39;-&#39;, $m, $n ) { $m - $n }
multi op ( &#39;/&#39;, $m, $n ) { $m / $n }
multi op ( &#39;*&#39;, $m, $n ) { $m * $n }
</@ops2;></pre>

I struggled for a bit to figure out what I wanted to do in <code>evaluate</code>. For a long time I tried to force a situation where I&#39;d use the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/Z">zip meta operator</a>, <code>Z</code>, to merge the digits and the operators. If I could do that, I could stringify and EVAL that. Yeah, that&#39;s disgusting and requires a secret pragma, but I got stuck on that idea. The problem was the ugliness of operator list having one less item than the digits list. The <code>Z</code> wants to use the same number of elements from both sides and will cycle back to the beginning of the shorter list. For awhile I&#39;d mutate the operator list to add the empty string at the end. I never liked this and it made everything harder than it needed to be.

While I was goofing around with that, I had the idea that I could zip the lists myself. As long as there was something in <code>@ops</code>, take one item from that list and two items from <code>@digits</code> and push them onto a new array:

<pre class="brush:plain">
@temp-array.push: @digits[0], @ops[0], @digits[1];
</pre>

It took me much longer that it should have to realize that I didn&#39;t need the temporary array. I&#39;ll grab the same elements, figure out the result, and replace those two numbers with the single number I just computed. When <code>@ops</code> was empty, I should have the answer in <code>@digits</code>. Boom. But, I still did the zip thing to make a string that represented the operation so I know how I got it.

To compute the intermediate results I created some <code>multi</code> subs with similar signatures, but I used a literal string as the first thing in the signature. This is how I&#39;d translate the strings representing the operators into actual operations. I could have done the same thing with <code>given</code>, but I didn&#39;t:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $result = do {
	given $o {
		when &#39;+&#39; { $m + $n }
		when &#39;-&#39; { $m - $n }
		when &#39;*&#39; { $m * $n }
		when &#39;/&#39; { $m / $n }
		}
	};
</pre>

When I run this, I get output like this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Total candidates: 768
Starting to send to channels
SOLUTION! 5/ 6+ 2* 6 = 17
Done sending to channels: 1.5209437 seconds
Thread 13 handled 55 candidates
Thread 6 handled 57 candidates
Thread 3 handled 656 candidates
Total handled was 768
</pre>

<h2>A digression of threading</h2>

Notice that one of the threads handled many more candidates. This isn&#39;t true for every run. More often, all threads handle close to the same number of candidates. But, whenever that happened the program was much slower by about half a second. That probably means I&#39;m using too many threads. If I changed the code to create only one promise, it&#39;s very fast:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Total candidates: 768
Starting to send to channels
Done sending to channels: 0.24503289 seconds
SOLUTION! 5/ 6+ 2* 6 = 17
Thread 4 handled 768 candidates
Total handled was 768
</pre>

This sniffs of a synchronization problem. If threads compete for the same physical processor, they have to cooperate (and something has to help them do that). I wasn&#39;t concerned about making this fast because I wanted to play with the features, but its something to think about for production programming.

Here&#39;s the overall timing for three promises. Notice the user time is about two times the real time because multiple threads are working at the same time:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ time perl6 pick-* 6 6 5 2 17
Total candidates: 768
Starting to send to channels
Done sending to channels: 2.0787578 seconds
Thread 6 handled 50 candidates
SOLUTION! 5/ 6+ 2* 6 = 17
Thread 4 handled 344 candidates
Thread 3 handled 374 candidates
Total handled was 768

real	0m3.294s
user	0m7.836s
sys	0m0.843s
</pre>

And for one promise, the user time and real time are about the same, and both are lower than using three threads:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ time perl6 pick-* 6 6 5 2 17
Total candidates: 768
Starting to send to channels
Done sending to channels: 0.2340613 seconds
SOLUTION! 5/ 6+ 2* 6 = 17
Thread 4 handled 768 candidates
Total handled was 768

real	0m2.088s
user	0m2.148s
sys	0m0.276s
</pre>

If there&#39;s a lot of lag in the processing (like fetching a resource or waiting), slicing operations into threads can have them wait together. Since those threads don&#39;t need to use the processor to wait, they aren&#39;t competing and getting in each other&#39;s way.

Here&#39;s a stripped down version of my previous program where most of the processing of each item isn&#39;t actual work:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $channel = Channel.new;

my $threads = @*ARGS[0] // 1;
put &quot;Using $threads threads&quot;;

my @promises;
for 0 ... ^$threads {
	@promises.push: start {
		react  {
			whenever $channel -&gt; $item {
				put &quot;Thread {$*THREAD.id} handing $item&quot;;
				sleep $item % 3
				}
			}
		};
	}

for ^37 {
	$channel.send( $_ )
	}

$channel.close;

await |@promises;
</pre>

With one thread, it takes about 37 seconds on the wallclock, but notice the user time is really low:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ time perl6 wait.p6
Using 1 threads
Thread 3 handing 0
...
Thread 3 handing 34
Thread 3 handing 35
Thread 3 handing 36

real	0m36.359s
user	0m0.278s
sys	0m0.067s
</pre>

Three threads can sleep simultaneously and can be much faster. The user time is about the same, but the wallclock time is less than half what it was before:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ time perl6 wait.p6 3
Using 3 threads
Thread 4 handing 0
Thread 3 handing 1
...
Thread 3 handing 33
Thread 3 handing 36

real	0m15.637s
user	0m0.281s
sys	0m0.112s
</pre>

<h3>A slight digression on EVAL</h3>

As part of my initial idea, I tried to create a string version of the solution and <code>EVAL</code> the whole thing. That&#39;s expedient if not prudent, but sometimes you want the answer any way you can get it and don&#39;t care about the purity or cleverness. I can easily make a list of all of the combinations of three operators (one less than the number of digits):

<pre>
$ perl6
&gt; my @a = &lt; + - / * &gt;

&gt; [X] @a xx 3
((+ + +) (+ + -) (+ + /) (+ + *) (+ - +) (+ - -) (+ - /) (+ - *) (+ / +) (+ / -) (+ / /) (+ / *) (+ * +) (+ * -) (+ * /) (+ * *) (- + +) (- + -) (- + /) (- + *) (- - +) (- - -) (- - /) (- - *) (- / +) (- / -) (- / /) (- / *) (- * +) (- * -) (- * /) (- * *) (/ + +) (/ + -) (/ + /) (/ + *) (/ - +) (/ - -) (/ - /) (/ - *) (/ / +) (/ / -) (/ / /) (/ / *) (/ * +) (/ * -) (/ * /) (/ * *) (* + +) (* + -) (* + /) (* + *) (* - +) (* - -) (* - /) (* - *) (* / +) (* / -) (* / /) (* / *) (* * +) (* * -) (* * /) (* * *))
</pre>

If I wanted to make a string like <code>6+6+5-2</code> with the <code>Z</code> operator, I&#39;d need something at the end to come after the <code>2</code>. It can&#39;t be another operator though. I wanted something like this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @digits = 6, 6, 5, 2;
my @ops    = <+ * -></+>;
my @perms  = @digits.permutations.unique( :with(&amp;[eqv]) );

my @cross = [X] @ops xx ( @digits.elems - 1 );

my @results = ( @perms X @cross )
	.map(  { my @d= (|.[1], &#39;&#39;); .[0] &gt;&gt;~&gt;&gt; @d } )
	.map(  { say &quot;$_ = &quot; ~ EVAL ~$_; $_  } )
	.grep( { 17 == EVAL $_ } )
</pre>

Even when I solved that, another problem came up. When I <code>EVAL</code> the statement, Perl 6 has a particular order of operations where the problem actually goes from left to right without precedence. That&#39;s not explicitly stated in the problem, but it&#39;s part of the problem. It took me a bit to figure out why I wasn&#39;t seeing any solutions this way.

Besides, I was trying to avoid the <a href="/2016/12/01/quick-tip-16-explosive-combinatorials/">combinatorial explosion</a> and the time to create the giant list only to go through it to tear it apart when I can do it in fewer steps.

I&#39;d later discover that although I&#39;d found a candidate for the the <code>6 6 5 2</code> situation, I hadn&#39;t actually solved the puzzle correctly. Besides the combinations of digits and operators, there was a third set of permutations. I needed all the orders of operations. But, let&#39;s think about Mark Jason&#39;s solution now.

<h3>Back to Mark Jason&#39;s solution</h3>

After I&#39;d figured out what I wanted to do, I looked back to see what Mark Jason had done. I won&#39;t re-explicate <a href="http://blog.plover.com/math/24-puzzle.html">his approach</a>, but I do want to see how similar we were.

He also used a queue. I had mine in a channel and he maintained a list. I&#39;d say that was about the same idea with different phenotypes.

He created a way to process two numbers at a time and replace them with their result. His added to a history string each time whereas I made the history string ahead of time. His solution was different because each combination of digits and operators represented a tree of solutions. You can do the first pair of digits first, or the last pair first, or the middle pair first. Then, you go through that for what&#39;s left. I&#39;d accidentally found a solution to the particular digits because those worked in left to right order. But, I couldn&#39;t find a solution to <code>8 8 3 3 == 24</code> because there isn&#39;t one that evaluates left to right. I hadn&#39;t handled the situation where I do the operations in other orders, like this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
8 ÷ (3 - (8÷3)) = 24
</pre>

There are actually six paths through the possible combinations of four digits and three operators. There were various ways that I could handle this. I could make all of those candidates and add them to the channel, or I could have the thing that takes the existing candidates generate sub problems and add those to the channel. This would mess up my tidy and apparently unclever solution to getting the history.

And, here&#39;s a good place to back up for a moment. Had I thought about this problem more and paid attention to his note about <code>8 8 3 3 == 24</code>, I would have made a test case for that and noticed I couldn&#39;t solve it. I do that when I&#39;m doing production programming and am very careful about the specification, but I wasn&#39;t fastidious here. I think my hubris got in the way. However, I did notice my omission as I was double-checking my work. It&#39;s a bit heart stopping to realize such a thing right before you were about to push to master though. ;)

After playing with this much longer than I should have, I came up with something close to what Mark Jason did. I took longer because I was trying quite hard to avoid his solution and I was trying to be clever in Perl 6. He created nodes for each computation (with the starting trivial case of the result being the starting digit). As he carried those along, he combined two nodes to create a new node with the new result but also a new string version of the combined history of those two nodes. While I was trying to avoid this, I was doing the same idea with a differen&#39;t implementation. I didn&#39;t have a fresh idea (other that creating an RPN calculator class, until I realized that it was still the same idea).

I&#39;ve adjusted a few things from my previous program and explained some
of the trickier accounting to get the history. There&#39;s plenty more I don&#39;t like about my implementation, but it&#39;s good enough that I can move on to other problems:

<pre class="brush:plain">

		<description><![CDATA[I had a problem where I wanted the longest string from a list. I didn&#39;t want to sort because I wanted to do it with a single pass. (The comments show sorting through <code>max</code>, which I was also avoiding). <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
# quote words, but with quote protection!
my @strings = qww/
	&quot;This is a line&quot;
	short
	&quot;A very very long string maybe, certainly the longest&quot;
	other
	not
	this
	a
	one
	or
	even
	1
	/;

# If you give one thing to sort, it does that to both things and
# compares with camp
my ($longest) = @strings.sort( *.chars ).[*-1];
</pre>

Instead, I decided to use the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Reduction_Operators">reduction operator</a> with an operator that I make up (and limit to the lexical scope). The infix <code>longest</code> takes two strings and returns the longest. I let the reduction take care of the rest:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my sub infix:<longest> { $^a.chars &gt; $^b.chars ?? $^a !! $^b }
my $longest = [longest] @strings;

say &quot;Longest is ｢$longest｣&quot;;
</longest></pre>

Some commenters point out that calling <code>.max</code> does the same thing. Looking in the <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/8bf67298c7bac51790e924efc125e4f8f7600013/src/core/Any-iterable-methods.pm">Rakudo source for max, you see that it&#39;s single pass too:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $longest = @strings.max: *.chars;
say &quot;Longest is ｢$longest｣&quot;;
</pre>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has a wealth of comparison operators so I don&#39;t have to do a lot of work to test complex data structures. Consider the case where I want to test two lists. I might reach for the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_eq"><code>eq</code></a> and think that it works. Here&#39;s a demonstration of that in the REPL: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) eq ( 1, 2, 4 )
False
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) eq ( 1, 2, 3 )
True
</pre>

That looks like it works. The list that has different elements returns <code>False</code> and the one that looks like it has the same elements returns <code>True</code>. But, this is a quirk of my choice of test cases. Had I read the docs (and, admit it, many of us only do that when something expected happens), I would have known that <code>eq</code> coerces its arguments to strings and compares those. It is, after all, a string comparison operator (although in a multi-dispatch language you (and I) might guess such operators would multi-dispatch).

Using <code>eq</code> breaks if lists with different values stringify the same way, like these. Since the string coercion joins the elements with a space, spaces at the start or end of elements make it impossible to distinguish the separator from the values:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, &#39;2 &#39;, 3 ) eq ( 1, 2, &#39; 3&#39; )
True
</pre>

That&#39;s no good. But, this is why Perl 6 has more comparison operators. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_eq"><code>eqv</code></a> tests that two things have the same values:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, &#39;2 &#39;, 3 ) eqv ( 1, 2, &#39; 3&#39; )
False
</pre>

This extends to deeper levels even. The values and the structure must be the same. Even if the ultimate scalar values are the same, they have show up in the structure in the same way:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, 2, (4,5) ) eqv ( 1, (2,4), 5 )
False
</pre>

And even to the object identity. And Array may hold the same values, but it is not the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, 2, (4,5) ) eqv ( 1, 2, [4,5] )
False
</pre>

Besides <code>eq</code> and <code>eqv</code>, Perl 6 has the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_==="><code>===</code></a> that tests for object identity. This was the start of my thinking on this post, but more about that in a moment. Even if the two lists have the same values and structure, they aren&#39;t the same object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) === ( 1, 2, 3 )
False
</pre>

But, I might have the same object stored differently. This Array and Scalar are the same because they store the same object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my @array = ( 1, 2, 3 )
[1 2 3]
&gt; my $scalar = @array
[1 2 3]
&gt; @array === $scalar
True
</pre>

A change in one shows up in the other, which is almost a non-sensical thing to say because there is no &quot;other&quot;. It&#39;s the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; $scalar[*-1] = &#39;Hamadryas&#39;
Hamadryas
&gt; @array
[1 2 Hamadryas]
</pre>

And here where this came up for me. I need the permutations of a list (which, as you know, if the <i>ordered</i> structure that allows the same value to show up multiple times). Consider permutations of <code>(1, 3, 3)</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations
((1 3 3) (1 3 3) (3 1 3) (3 3 1) (3 1 3) (3 3 1))
</pre>

I might not care that two permutations are <code>(1, 3, 3)</code> show up twice as long as I process one of them. Suppose I want the list of all the values of the sum of the first two items multiplied by the third:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.map: { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] }
(12 12 12 6 12 6)
</pre>

I&#39;ve done that operation six times, but if I only care about the unique values, I&#39;ve done a lot more work than I needed to do to get two value:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.map( { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] } ).unique
(12 6)
</pre>

In this example it&#39;s not a big deal, but imagine much larger lists and more complicated operations. Consider how that makes <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction">junctions</a> much larger:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; any( (1,3,3).permutations.map( { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] } ) ) &gt; 13
any(False, False, False, False, False, False)
</pre>

Curiously, this gives a Junction back instead of a Boolean, but I&#39;ve asked about that in the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1269">docs repo</a> and on <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131114">RT</a>.

So, I might try <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/List#routine_unique"><code>.unique</code></a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.unique
((1 3 3) (1 3 3) (3 1 3) (3 3 1) (3 1 3) (3 3 1))
</pre>

That didn&#39;t reduce the list, though. That method checks pairs of items with <code>===</code>. That&#39;s the check for object identity. The duplicated permutations look the same because they have the same values in the same order, but they are different objects.

No matter. I can tell <code>.unique</code> to compare elements any way that I like by using the <code>:with</code> adverb. If I use <code>eqv</code>, I end up with only the permutations I can distinguish:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.unique( :with(&amp;[eqv]) )
((1 3 3) (3 1 3) (3 3 1))
</pre>

Now I process half the number of elements:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; any( (1,3,3).permutations.unique( :with(&amp;[eqv]) ).map( { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] } ) ) &gt; 13
any(False, False, False)
</pre>

There are many other <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_eqv">comparison operations</a>.  Some of them might not give you a &quot;wrong&quot; answer, but you might end up doing more processing than you need to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<i><b>UPDATE</b> - <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">Rakudo is now in Chocolatey</a> so most of this is really easy now.</i>

<a href="https://www.appveyor.com">AppVeyor</a> provides continuous testing on Windows. I wanted to try it with Perl 6 since I don&#39;t want to ignore Windows in <i>Learning Perl 6</i>. I found a some configuration examples, but none of them satisfied me. I spent a bit too much time messing around with PowerShell to produce <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test/blob/master/.appveyor.yml">my own AppVeyor configuration</a>. <!--more-->

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="682" src="/images/appveyor.png" width="500">
</div>
</div>

I had my own simple requirements:

<ul>
<li>I want to use the latest Rakudo Star, like most people will for everyday work
</li><li>I want the build to be fast. 
	<ul>
	<li>Don&#39;t build Rakudo every time
	</li><li>Cache whatever I can
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>

Along the way I ran into several inadequacies in PowerShell and various other Microsoft tools. These things provide a challenge to the non-interactive programmer.

But, I have something that works. The first time around I install <a href="https://www.strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> and <a href="">Rakudo Star</a>. If everything in the build goes well, AppVeyor caches these installations so I don&#39;t need to do them again. I&#39;ve also setup the config with a kludey way to invalidate that cache (which <a href="http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/questions/1310-delete-cache">AppVeyor still declines to provide as a button on the website</a>). 

I install <a href="https://www.strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> to get <a href="http://perltricks.com/article/177/2015/6/9/Get-to-grips-with-Prove--Perl-s-test-workhorse/">prove</a>. That&#39;s easy because it has a <a href="http://perltricks.com/article/177/2015/6/9/Get-to-grips-with-Prove--Perl-s-test-workhorse/">chocolately</a> package that AppVeyor can figure out on its own. 

Rakudo is a bit tougher. There&#39;s an old chocolately package (I&#39;m figuring out how to fix that). I download the latest Rakudo, but I wasting a lot of time wondering if the installer was doing anything. That installer works in the background in another process, so <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/heaths/2005/11/15/waiting-for-msiexec-exe-to-finish/">Powershell doesn&#39;t know how to wait for it to finish</a>. All of that research made me miss Perl (of either flavor) where it&#39;s easy to get answers to even difficult questions. Many communities can&#39;t get answers to simple questions. But, that&#39;s life.

After that, everything is easy and looks like the basic continuous integration testing.

I&#39;m done working on it until I have another problem, but there are <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test/issues">some other things I&#39;d like my config to do</a>:

<ul>
<li>Report code coverage
</li><li>Send reports to some sort of CPAN Testers thing
</li><li>Allow people to build against different versions of Rakudo (&quot;hey, it worked last month!&quot;)
</li></ul>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[mathjax]

Perl 6 has some amazing numerical features, including builtin <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Complex">complex number</a> computations. You might never need these, but they permit a bit of math geekry that I find quite pleasing. That pleasure is especially strong in Euler&#39;s Formula: <!--more-->

$$
e^{i\pi} = -1
$$

It&#39;s even more pleasing when I move everything to one side (and this will become important to Perl 6 later):

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

This tiny formula has everything you need to know about everything (almost). There&#39;s the natural base, the imaginary unit, the ratio of a circle&#39;s circumference to its diameter, and the multiplicative and additive identities. Curiously how all of that works out.

When I try this in the Perl 6 REPL I almost got the right answer, but not quite:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; e**(i*pi)
-1+1.22464679914735e-16i
&gt; e**(i*pi) == -1
False
</pre>

That&#39;s right. I <i>almost</i> get the right answer. Most of you are probably used to these minor imprecisions and the practical programming considerations that come with them.

That&#39;s not a problem because Perl 6 anticipates these situations with the <code>=~=</code>, or the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_=~=">approximately-equal operator</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; e**(i*pi) =~= -1
True
</pre>

So, close enough is good enough for horseshoes, hand grenades, and now Perl 6.

I can also use <code>≅</code> (U+2245, ᴀᴘᴘʀᴏxɪᴍᴀᴛᴇʟʏ ᴇqᴜᴀʟ ᴛᴏ) version of the operator:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; e**(i*pi) ≅ -1
True
</pre>

The <code>$*TOLERANCE</code> variable controls how almost &quot;almost&quot; is. By default it&#39;s 1e-15. That&#39;s really small but its still larger than the <code>1.22464679914735e-16i</code> extra bit I saw.

I need to be careful though. The <code>=~=</code> looks at the <i>relative</i> difference instead of the <i>absolute</i> difference. Here&#39;s something you might not expect to be approximately equal since the values differ by 1 (which you think is much larger than 1e-15):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 9999999999999999 =~= 9999999999999998
True
</pre>

It&#39;s their relative difference that matters though. That&#39;s the absolute value of their difference divided by the least absolute value of the two:

$$
\frac{| x - y |}{ min( |x|, |y| ) }
$$

Turn that into Perl 6 (I really like that infix <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_min"><code>min</code></a> operator):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; sub relative-difference ( $x, $y ) { abs( $x - $y ) / ( abs($x) min abs($y) ) }
&gt; relative-difference( 999999999999999, 999999999999998 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
1.000000e-15
&gt; relative-difference( 999999999999999, 999999999999997 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
2.000000e-15
</pre>

This works because very small differences in the large numbers might be less significant as very small differences in small numbers?

Huh?

It sounds like double talk, but this takes into account the size of the numbers when looking at the tolerance. Consider the case at the small end. Any value smaller than 1e-15 is within 1e-15 of 1e-15, but that isn&#39;t very helpful. The relative difference takes the sizes of the values into account. Thus, this is false because the relative difference is almost an order of magnitude:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 1e-15 =~= 1e-16
False
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-16 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.000000e+00
</pre>

This way, the tolerance value doesn&#39;t overwhelm the comparison as you get close to the tolerance itself.

That&#39;s not the end of the story, though. Why is this one different? These are the same values with one moved over to the other side of the comparison:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 1e-15 - 1e-16 =~= 0
True
</pre>

There&#39;s a problem with relative difference. As the smaller value gets much closer to zero, the relative difference goes to infinity:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-17 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.900000e+01
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-18 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.990000e+02
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-19 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.999000e+03
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-21 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.999990e+05
</pre>

The absolute difference in all of those are less than 1e-15, but the relative difference are very high. So, when one side of my comparison is exactly 0, the <code>=~=</code> switches to the absolute difference. That&#39;s why <code>1e-15 - 1e-16 =~= 0</code> is <code>True</code>.

This means you can get different answers depending on the structure of the comparison:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 9999999999999999 - 9999999999999998 =~= 0 # absolute
False
&gt; 9999999999999999 =~= 9999999999999998     # relative
True
</pre>

If I check that the difference is close to zero, I compare the absolute difference. If I compare two non-zero values to each other, I compare their relative difference.

Although it doesn&#39;t matter in this case, that&#39;s one of the pleasures of moving the 1 to the right:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; e**(i*pi) + 1 =~= 0
True
</pre>

And, here&#39;s one final tidbit. You can change the tolerance. If you want two and two to be five, select the right tolerance level:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $*TOLERANCE = 0.21; 2 + 2 =~= 5      # relative
True
&gt; my $*TOLERANCE = 0.21; 2 + 2 - 5 =~= 0  # absolute
False
&gt; my $*TOLERANCE = 1.1; 2 + 2 - 5 =~= 0   # absolute
True
</pre>

Now I want the string version of this.]]></description>

I went looking for some sort of official test corpus to throw at parsers. Googling gave me some internal links to json.org for a tool called <a href="http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/">JSON_Checker</a> that has some test files.  As I created my own JSON grammar (which looks just like all the examples I list at the end of this post, really), I used JSON_Checker files as the tests. I fixed some tests and put my versions in it my <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/json-acceptance-tests">json-acceptance-tests GitHub repo</a>.

<pre class="brush:plain">
use Terminal::ANSIColor;

# https://github.com/briandfoy/json-acceptance-tests
my $pass_fail_directory = @*ARGS[0]; # wherever you put them
my @files = dir( $pass_fail_directory, test =&gt; rx/ &#39;.json&#39; $ / );

# two grammars I created, which aren&#39;t important here.
my @grammars = &lt;Grammar::JSON Grammar::RFC7159&gt;;

for @grammars -&gt; $grammar {
	put &quot;Trying grammar $grammar&quot;;
	require ::($grammar);
	try-grammar( $grammar, @files );
	put &quot;\n&quot;;
	}

sub try-grammar ( $grammar-class, @files ) {
	state @tag = (
		colored( &#39;NOT OK&#39;, &#39;white on_red&#39;   ),
		colored( &#39;  OK  &#39;, &#39;white on_green&#39; ),
		);
	state %expected = (
		&#39;pass&#39; =&gt; 0,
		&#39;fail&#39; =&gt; 1,
		);

	for @files -&gt; $file {
		$file.IO.basename ~~ m/ ^ $&lt;result&gt; = [ pass | &#39;fail&#39; ] $&lt;number&gt; = \d+/;
		my ( $expected, $number ) = $&lt;result&gt;, $&lt;number&gt;;
		my $result = ::($grammar-class).parsefile( $file );

		say @tag[ (%expected{$expected} + $result.so) % 2 ] ~ &quot; { $file.IO.basename }&quot;;
		}
	}
</pre>

Here&#39;s the output, which I&#39;ve labeled nicely with <a href="https://github.com/tadzik/Terminal-ANSIColor">Terminal::ANSIColor</a>. Those failures aren&#39;t real. One doesn&#39;t believe that anything other than an object or array can be a top-level value and the other thinks you should stop parsing at a certain depth.

		<title>Three ways to pretty print Perl 6</title>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve had my head down working on the &quot;Grammars&quot; chapter, and along
the way I&#39;ve been using <code>dd</code> to look at things. It&#39;s better than nothing, but it&#39;s also very compact and unwrapped. I really wanted a pretty printer, and I was even prepared to write my own. But, I don&#39;t have to. Here are three modules that can do it for you. <!--more-->

But Jeff Goff has already written <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp">Pretty::Printer</a>. I wasn&#39;t able to install it with panda or zef (and it&#39;s not listed on <a href="http://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a>). But, you can get it from the <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp">perl6-pp GitHub repo</a>.

Here&#39;s a structure that I want to inspect. It includes a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Match">Match</a> object with a named capture:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;
use lib qw/lib/;

my $match = (&#39;123456789&#39; ~~ m:g/$&lt;digit&gt;=(\d+:)/);

my %hash =
	dog =&gt; &#39;Nikki&#39;,
	cat =&gt; &#39;Buster&#39;,
	butterfly =&gt; &#39;Hamadryas&#39;,
	array =&gt; [ 5 .. 10 ],
	complex =&gt; {
		one =&gt; 37,
		two =&gt; &quot;Buster&quot;,
		three =&gt; [ 3..7 ],
		four =&gt; {
			array =&gt; [ 4..7 ],
			hash  =&gt; {
				dog =&gt; &#39;Newfie&#39;,
				}
			},
		},
	match =&gt; $match;
	;
</pre>

I can use the built-in <code>dd</code> to get this very compact representation that just needs whitespace in the right places:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Hash %hash = {:array($[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]), :butterfly(&quot;Hamadryas&quot;), :cat(&quot;Buster&quot;), :complex(${:four(${:array($[4, 5, 6, 7]), :hash(${:dog(&quot;Newfie&quot;)})}), :one(37), :three($[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), :two(&quot;Buster&quot;)}), :dog(&quot;Nikki&quot;), :match($(Match.new(ast =&gt; Any, list =&gt; (), hash =&gt; Map.new((:digit(Match.new(ast =&gt; Any, list =&gt; (), hash =&gt; Map.new(()), orig =&gt; &quot;123456789&quot;, to =&gt; 9, from =&gt; 0)))), orig =&gt; &quot;123456789&quot;, to =&gt; 9, from =&gt; 0),))}
</pre>

With <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp/pull/2">Pretty::Printer</a> (using the <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp/pull/2">pull request I just sent</a>), I can choose some formatting options:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use Pretty::Printer;

my $pp = Pretty::Printer.new(
	pre-item-spacing       =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,
	post-item-spacing      =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,

	intra-group-spacing    =&gt; &quot;&quot;,

	pre-separator-spacing  =&gt; &#39;&#39;,
	post-separator-spacing =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,

	indent-style           =&gt; &quot;   &quot;,
	);

say $pp.pp( %hash );
</pre>

The output is a bit rough, but it&#39;s much easier for me to read, especially with the match stuff:

<pre class="brush:plain">
${
   :array($[
      5,
      6,
      7,
      8,
      9,
      10
   ]),
   :butterfly(&quot;Hamadryas&quot;),
   :cat(&quot;Buster&quot;),
   :complex(${
      :four(${
         :array($[
            4,
            5,
            6,
            7
         ]),
         :hash(${
            :dog(&quot;Newfie&quot;)
         })
      }),
      :one(37),
      :three($[
         3,

   }),
   :dog(&quot;Nikki&quot;),
   :match($(
         Match.new(${
                    :ast(Any),

                    :hash(Map.new(

                              :ast(Any),
                              :from(0),
                              :hash(Map.new()),
                              :list($()),
                              :orig(&quot;123456789&quot;),
                              :to(9)
                       })))),
                    :list($()),
                    :orig(&quot;123456789&quot;),
                    :to(9)
         })
   ))
}
</pre>

I find the output is a bit too detailed for most of my needs, but does fine with the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Match">Match</a> object. Although you can&#39;t see it here, the output can be colored if your terminal supports that:

		<title>BBEdit Text Filters in Perl 6</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2017/01/17/bbedit-text-filters-in-perl-6/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2017 14:26:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve been writing BBEdit <q href="http://bbeditextras.org/wiki/index.php?title=Text_Filters">Text Filters in Perl 6. This isn&#39;t revolutionary and I&#39;ve made no great hack. It&#39;s not a hidden part of the BBEdit docs, and it&#39;s not a feature unique to my favorite editor. You don&#39;t even need to use Perl 6; any unix interpreter will do. Your editor can probably do the same thing, and maybe even with the same programs.

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="430" src="/images/text_filters.png" style="border:0" width="500">
</div>
</div>


<!--more-->

In your <i>.../Application Support/BBEdit/Text Filters</i>, drop in any sort of Unix script you like (mine is actually in my Dropbox folder and thus shared across my network, a feature from <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/bbedit10.html">BBEdit 10</a>). It uses the shebang line to run the program just as it does if you run it from the command line. This text filter gets the text you selected in the editor. Whatever you print to standard output replaces the selected text.

I wanted to turn a string into the codepoint numbers and names that represent their characters. Here&#39;s that in Perl 6:

<pre class="brush:plain">
#!/Applications/Rakudo/bin/perl6

$*IN
	.lines
	.map: {
		eager ($_.ords Z, $_.uninames).map: {
			printf &quot;%04x %s\n&quot;, $_.list
			}
		}
</pre>

This turns text such as &quot;Hamadryas&quot; into this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
0048 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H
0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A
006d LATIN SMALL LETTER M
0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A
0064 LATIN SMALL LETTER D
0072 LATIN SMALL LETTER R
0079 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y
0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A
0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S
</pre>

There&#39;s another text filter I like. I use it to align <code>=</code> and <code>=&gt;</code> (or anything that starts with <code>=</code> in code:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $longest = 0;
my @lines;

for $*IN.lines -&gt; $line {
	my @columns = $line.split( / \s+ &#39;=&#39; \S+ \s+ /, 2 );
	$longest max= @columns.[0].chars;
	push @lines, @columns;
	}

for @lines -&gt; $line {
	printf &quot;%-{$longest}s =&gt; %s\n&quot;, $line.list;
	}
</pre>

Notice that <code>max=</code>. That&#39;s a binary assignment with the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_max">max</a> operator. That&#39;s like <code>$longest = $longest max @columns.[0].chars</code>.

Now I need to figure out why BBEdit won&#39;t allow me to assign a keyboard shortcut to it.

		<title>Buffers, hexdump, and Perl 6 Power Tools</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2017/01/09/buffers-hexdump-and-perl-6-power-tools/</link>

		<description><![CDATA[I was playing the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Buf">buffers</a> and reading binary data but I ended up implementing a <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/Perl6PowerTools/blob/master/bin/hexdump">Perl 6 version of hexdump</a>. Looking for a place to put it, I figured <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/Perl6PowerTools">Perl6PowerTools</a> might as well exist. Now it has a single program, but I figure there are people who will look at the original <a href="http://www.perlpowertools.com/">PerlPowerTools</a> and want to translate some of those to Perl 6.

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="384" src="/images/hexdump.png" style="border:0" width="500">
</div>
</div>

<!--more-->

There&#39;s quite a bit going on in the program, but I&#39;ll pull out just a bit of it. 

<pre class="brush:plain">
	my @options = qw/ C c d b o x /.grep: { $::($_) };
	while my Buf $buf = $fh.read( octets_to_read( $counter, $n ) ) {
		# You can select more than one option at a time
		# change the option order to change the output order
		# These correspond to the named Bool parameters in the signature
		for @options -&gt; $option {
			put $counter.fmt( &#39;%08x  &#39; ), &amp;::(&quot;show_$option&quot;)($buf);
			}
		$counter += $buf.elems;
		last if $n &amp;&amp; $counter &gt;= $n;
		}
</pre>

I implemented the <code>-C</code>, <code>-c</code>, <code>-d</code>, <code>-b</code>, <code>-o</code>, and <code>-x</code> switches. Each of these present the data in a different way, making all the combinations of octet or words with octal, decimal, or hexadecimal. 

Surprisingly, the hexdump I have on my Mac will happily do all of these at once. That means I have it a bit easier since I don&#39;t have to create an option processing hierarchy to exclude others. I figured that Perl 6&#39;s <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/multi">multi methods</a> would be good for that, which is one of the reasons I started writing the program. Even when I found out I didn&#39;t need that I kept going.

So, on each group of octets that I read, I have the opportunity to print several lines. I need to check which options are set to True. I could do that with a lot of repeated code:

<pre class="brush:plain">
		put $counter.fmt( &#39;%08x  &#39; ), show_C($buf) if $C;
		put $counter.fmt( &#39;%08x  &#39; ), show_c($buf) if $c;
		put $counter.fmt( &#39;%08x  &#39; ), show_d($buf) if $d;
		...
</pre>

Instead, I use a variable to decide the variable name with <code>$::($some_variable)</code>. I filter out all the ones that are False:

<pre class="brush:plain">
	my @options = qw/ C c d b o x /.grep: { $::($_) };
</pre>

When it&#39;s time to output something, I go through the options that I have left. Each one has an associated subroutine, which I lookup in the same way:

<pre class="brush:plain">
		for @options -&gt; $option {
			put $counter.fmt( &#39;%08x  &#39; ), &amp;::(&quot;show_$option&quot;)($buf);
			}
</pre>

I also thought of translating those subroutine lookups beforehand but I didn&#39;t get that far. I don&#39;t really need to keep constructing the subroutine name. That&#39;s something I can fix later.

There&#39;s something that&#39;s probably surprising to Perl 5 people. This little trick isn&#39;t limited to a particular set of variables. It works with lexicals too:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $foo = &quot;Some value&quot;;

put &quot;The value of \$foo is &quot;, $::(&#39;foo&#39;); # works just fine.
</pre>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://github.com/pudge">Chris Nandor</a> has been bugging me to use the <a href="https://github.com/Marchex/github-api-tools">Github tools he helped to develop for Marchex</a>, so when <a href="/2017/01/03/search-the-perl-6-repos-with-etsys-hound/">I posted about Hound</a> he showed me another way to search multiple <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repos at the same time. This version only works if everything is on GitHub (or your Enterprise version of that), but the Hound version can work with whatever mix of version control systems have, either local, remote, or both.

This task is really simple, so it&#39;s not that impressive for those tools, but you can still search multiple GitHub repos. It only looks like you need a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">GitHub personal access token</a> because the tools assume you&#39;ll want to do all the other stuff too. The stuff here doesn&#39;t actually use the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>.

Now I put it all together. This is really the sort of thing that Perl 5 was made to do. Here&#39;s a quickie Perl 5 example (and hey, last time is was Go, so I&#39;m getting closer). This constructs the right query, submits it to GitHub, and opens your browser to the results.

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!/Users/brian/bin/perls/perl5.14.2
use v5.10;

# You might have Enterprise, so this would be different
$ENV{GITHUB_HOST}  //= &#39;github.com&#39;;
$ENV{GITHUB_TOKEN} //= &#39;vanilla nut taps&#39;; # can be anything, but var needs to be defined

# https://github.com/Marchex/github-api-tools
my $binary = &#39;/Users/brian/bin/perls/github_search5.14.2&#39;;

my $repos = join &#39; &#39;, map { &quot;repo:$_&quot; } qw(
	rakudo/rakudo
	perl6/nqp
	perl6/doc
	perl6/roast
	perl6/specs
	);

@ARGV = qw(Mayor of Dunkin) unless @ARGV;
my @command = (
	$binary,
	&#39;-O&#39;,
	&#39;-f&#39;,
	&quot;&#39;$repos&#39;&quot;,
	@ARGV
	);

say &quot;@command&quot;;
system { $command[0] } @command;
</pre>

To run it, I give it something to search:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ search_perl6 encoding
<pre>

(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=encoding%20%27repo%3Arakudo%2Frakudo%20repo%3Aperl6%2Fnqp%20repo%3Aperl6%2Fdoc%20repo%3Aperl6%2Froast%20repo%3Aperl6%2Fspecs%27&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Code">See that result</a>).

But, I don&#39;t really need any Perl 5 here. Although the Marchex tools are in Perl 5, my program merely glues together a bunch of stuff then shells out. The Perl 6 version doesn&#39;t look that much different:

<pre class="brush:plain">
#!/Applications/Rakudo/bin/perl6
use v6;

# You might have Enterprise, so this would be different
%*ENV{&#39;GITHUB_HOST&#39;}  //= &#39;github.com&#39;;
%*ENV{&#39;GITHUB_TOKEN&#39;} //= &#39;gfy&#39;; # can be anything, but var needs to be defined

# https://github.com/Marchex/github-api-tools
my $binary = &#39;/Users/brian/bin/perls/github_search5.14.2&#39;;

my $repos = q:w{
	rakudo/rakudo
	perl6/nqp
	perl6/doc
	perl6/roast
	perl6/specs
	}.map( { &quot;repo:$_&quot; } ).join( &#39; &#39; );

@*ARGS = q:w/Mayor of Dunkin/ unless @*ARGS;
my @command = (
	$binary,
	&#39;-O&#39;,
	&#39;-f&#39;,
	&quot;&#39;$repos&#39;&quot;,
	|@*ARGS  # flatten that list with |
	);

say &quot;{@command}&quot;;
run |@command;  # From class Proc https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proc
</pre>

Either way I see two benefits here. I can do it from the command line and it will automatically open my browser with the results. And, I don&#39;t have to remember how to type out the query. Since it doesn&#39;t use the GitHub API, it also doesn&#39;t count against my search rate limit. So, maybe two and a half benefits.

</div>

I&#39;m working on <a href="https://www.learningperl6.org">Learning Perl 6</a> and I spend a lot of my time going between repos to suss out various things. Etsy&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/etsy/hound">Hound</a> is a tool that makes that easier, and I&#39;ve made a <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-hound">GitHub project with my setup</a>.

<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.perl6.org">Perl 6</a> development is spread over several repositories. That&#39;s a consequence that there&#39;s no <i>a priori</i> preferred implementation, and that&#39;s on purpose.

Anything that passes the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/roast">roast tests</a> is Perl 6. That has its own repo. <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">Rakudo</a> is one such implementation. It has its own repo.

But, Perl 6 is largely written in Perl 6. There&#39;s a smaller version of the language, <a href="https://github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP</a> for <b>N</b>ot <b>Q</b>uite <b>P</b>erl6, that targets the virtual machines. A smaller feature set makes it easier to implement new virtual targets and that should encourage more backends. NQP has its own repo.

And the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc">docs</a> have their own directory too.

That means it&#39;s not quite as simple as grepping (acking, whatever) a repository. These are separate projects that I&#39;d have to keep separately updated.

Etsy released a tool they call <a href="https://github.com/etsy/hound">hound</a>, written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>. They have instructions, but here&#39;s a summary:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Install Go 1.3+</a>. I used a binary package.
</li><li>Run <code>go get github.com/etsy/hound/cmds/...</code>
</li><li>Create a directory for <i>houndd</i> to do its work
</li><li>Create your <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-hound/blob/master/config.json">config.json</a> to list the repos in that directory
</li><li>Run <code>$GOPATH/bin/houndd</code> in that directory
</li><li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:6080">http://localhost:6080</a>
</li></ul>

I&#39;ve also built most of this into the <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-hound/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a>. Use the *run* target to get it going:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ make run

		<description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve already told you about the <a href="/2016/12/19/a-dedicated-learningperl6-twitter-account/">@LearningPerl6</a> twitter account, and I spent today setting up some stuff to collect what I&#39;m doing elsewhere. I&#39;m using <a href="http://dlvr.it">Dlvr.it</a> to put the interesting things on Twitter. This way you can see what I&#39;m working on and what I&#39;m thinking about. <!--more-->

<ul>
<li>a feed of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A2766176+%5Bperl6%5D">my StackOverflow Perl 6 questions</a>
</li><li>a feed of the tickets I add to the <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/">perl6 RT queue</a>
</li></ul>

<h3>StackOverflow</h3>

There&#39;s a <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com">StackExchange API</a>. I can get a feed of a particular user&#39;s questions, and from that, get the question text with another query. It&#39;s not so bad; you can see it in my <a href="https://gist.github.com/briandfoy/4b4025b8026e4eee26c11811ba1a7efe">stackfeed gist</a>. It&#39;s a bit hacky (and, Perl 5), but I started with something else I had. I watched as what I thought were some simple modules start to install a bunch of things I didn&#39;t need, so I switched to making XML by hand. Yeah, I did that. You&#39;ll have to excuse the flurry of tweets that showed up because I neglected to tell the feed processor to handle only the most recent so it did all of them. Oops.

If you don&#39;t want this one from Twitter, I also have it as a <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/downloads/stackoverflow-questions.xml">regular Atom feed through this site.</a>. I&#39;ll probably mess with it a bit more, but there it is.

<h3>The Perl 6 RT queue</h3>

The RT queue is a bit trickier since you can&#39;t get a feed out of <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/">the public interface</a>. I can log in, do a search, then find my secret feed URL in the upper right:

<div class="center image">
<div>
<img height="260" src="/images/rt-search-feeds.png" width="500">
<p>You only get the Feeds menu while logged in</p>
</div>
</div>

Since this is supposed to be a secret URL, I&#39;m not supposed to give it to the public. I can give it to Dlvr.it and let it post to @LearningPerl6 though.

If you have an RT account, you can create your own search, grab the feed for that, and add it to your own aggregator.]]></description>

		<title>indir() changes the directory just for its block</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<i>Update for April 2017: <code>indir</code> is now a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/indir">documented part of the language</a>.</i>

How many times have I wanted to change the current working directory for just one block? It&#39;s usually such a pain because I have to remember to change it back. <!--more-->

In Perl 6, the <code>indir</code> routine does this for me:

<pre class="brush:plain">
indir $some_dir, {
    ...; # do stuff in that directory
    }
</pre>

The current working directory is changed just for that block of code. When that block is done, the value is back to whatever it was before. That this is built into the language is quite pleasing to me (and the dependency-adverse contexts I tend to work in). There&#39;s no variable to mess with (in Perl 6 that would be <code>$*CWD</code>, which has some issues at the moment) and it reads nicely as a sentence.

This isn&#39;t documented yet (it only shows up in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/specs/master/S16-io.pod">Synopsis 16</a>, last changed 10 years ago, and was <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/beec02a6fa69e3ac290b4dd24c07d87a9f248b13/docs/announce/2014.10.md">announced as part of 2014.10</a>), but it&#39;s in there and it mostly works. At the moment (Rakudo 2016.11) it only works when the target directory is readable <i>and</i> writeable, but I&#39;ve filed <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130460">RT #130460</a> about that. And, I&#39;ve filed <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1091">GitHub #1091</a> about the lack of documentation (which depends on someone declaring what it should actually do). Since it&#39;s untested and undocumented, that means it might change or disappear. Consider that before you get too excited. But, how can you not get excited about something that makes common things really easy?

I feel a little bad that I&#39;m not stopping to fully investigate these corner cases, but if I did that I&#39;d never get any writing done for <i>Learning Perl 6</i>! Maybe someone else has the time to make this bit of Perl 6 tested and documented.]]></description>

		<title>Strip leading spaces from here-docs</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/12/25/strip-leading-spaces-from-here-docs/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 05:37:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2016/12/strip-leading-spaces-from-here-docs-with-v5-26/">Perl v5.26 steals Perl 6&#39;s feature to strip leading whitespace from here-docs</a>. I wrote about that for The Effective Perler, but here&#39;s the same thing for <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/quoting#Heredocs:_:to">Perl 6 here-docs</a>. As with most things, the Perl 5 feature is slightly different. <!--more-->

Before v5.26, you had to start your here-doc lines at the beginning of the line. This doesn&#39;t line up with the indention, which some people find annoying:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v5;

sub say_something {
	my $string =&lt;&lt;&#39;HERE&#39;;
This line is not indented
Neither is this line
And the delimiter is not indented
HERE

	print $string;
	}

say_something();
</pre>

Perl 6 already strips leading whitespace from the lines inside a here-doc. It

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

sub say_something {
	my $string = q:to/HERE/;
		This line is not indented
			But this line is indented
		And the delimiter is not indented
		HERE

	print $string;
	}

say_something();
</pre>

The whitespace before the final delimiter is stripped from each line in the string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
This line is not indented
	But this line is indented
And the delimiter is not indented
</pre>

This still works if you don&#39;t have the same whitespace before each line:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

sub say_something {
	my $string = q:to/HERE/;
		This line is not indented
			But this line is indented
And the delimiter is not indented
		HERE

	print $string;
	}

say_something();
</pre>

It works, but you get a warning (in Perl 5 this would be a compilation error). In my code I had two tabs; apparently it translates that into eight spaces:

<pre class="brush:plain">
This line is not indented
	But this line is indented
And the delimiter is not indented
Asked to remove 16 spaces, but the shortest indent is 0 spaces
  in any trim_heredoc at gen/moar/m-Perl6-Actions.nqp line 499
</pre>

It tries to strip as much whitespace as it can (up to the amount in front of the delimiter). Since it considers a tab as eight spaces, the amount of space it strips might make the string look different than your typing. This version has a mix of spaces and tabs (although something might translate this example before you get it):

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

sub say_something {
	my $string = q:to/HERE/;
		This line has two tabs
			This line has three tabs
                But this one has 16 spaces
		HERE

	print $string;
	}

say_something();
</pre>

Allow it looks like the last line is indented more, when it converts tabs to eight spaces, the third line isn&#39;t indented at all:

<pre class="brush:plain">
This line has two tabs
	This line has three tabs
But this one has 16 spaces
</pre>

But, a tab isn&#39;t just eight spaces. It&#39;s the number of spaces to get to the next multiple of 8. The last line of this here-doc mixes tabs and spaces:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

sub say_something {
	my $string = q:to/HERE/;
		This line has two tabs
			This line has three tabs
    	    But this one has 4 spaces, a tab, and 4 spaces
		HERE

	print $string;
	}

say_something();
</pre>

You get a warning. This time it thinks there are 12 spaces in the last line:

<pre class="brush:plain">
This line has two tabs
	This line has three tabs
But this one has 4 spaces, a tab, and 4 spaces
Asked to remove 16 spaces, but the shortest indent is 12 spaces
  in any trim_heredoc at gen/moar/m-Perl6-Actions.nqp line 499
</pre>

It&#39;s the same thing with more leading spaces:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

sub say_something {
	my $string = q:to/HERE/;
		This line has two tabs
			This line has three tabs
       	    But this one has 7 spaces, a tab, and 4 spaces
		HERE

	print $string;
	}

say_something();
</pre>

So, be careful how you specify those leading spaces (and how you accept patches and so on).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started a GitHub project to <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl5faq_in_perl6">translate the Perl 5 perlfaq to Perl 6</a>. For years I maintained those documents so they are a bit special to me. Sadly, the <a href="https://github.com/tpf/perlfaq">canonical TPF repo</a> started over in 2012 with the sources current in v5.15, so most of that history has been lost. Oh well. <!--more-->

I don&#39;t want to create a new FAQ for Perl 6, because an <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq.html">official FAQ</a> already exists. If that document steals from this new project, that&#39;s fine with me. I&#39;m doing this just because I am, and if you want to help or play with it, welcome! But, I&#39;m just translating and adapting, not adding or deleting.

I grabbed the perlfaq questions and put them into new documents, created a repo, and filled in some of the basic meta-answers for perlfaq1. I&#39;m curious how the rest of the perlfaq would turn out. The questions were things important to people twenty years ago. How does that hold up today?

<ul>
<li>Some things might not matter anymore in Perl 6
</li><li>Some things use different tools now
</li><li>The modules have all changed, and if they haven&#39;t, we can <a href="/2016/12/07/quick-tip-22-use-perl-5-modules-in-perl-6/">use the Perl 5 modules</a>.
</li></ul>

If it doesn&#39;t matter anymore, keeping the question but explaining the way Perl 6 handles it for you is something some people will appreciate. If it&#39;s a task-based question, people probably still have the question (and will have it frequently).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_ff">flip flop operator</a> isn&#39;t just something for politicians and nervous interface designers. It&#39;s a feature designed to turn on and off to set a window of processing. <!--more-->

Suppose I want to see all the words between two words in <i>/usr/share/dict/words</i> (your distro may place it elsewhere). I want to extract a window of lines from a big text.

The <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_ff">ff</a></code> operator is False until its lefthand expression is true, and then True until its righthand expression is True. After that, it&#39;s false. So, it turns on when the left side becomes true and turns off when the right side does.

Here&#39;s a program that reads lines from a file and prints the ones between the two words I specify:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub MAIN (
	Str :$file  = &#39;/usr/share/dict/words&#39;,
	Str :$first!,
	Str :$last!,
	) {
	my $fh = open( $file );

	for $fh.lines -&gt; $line {
		say $line if $line ~~ $first ff $line ~~ $last; # flip-flop
		}
	}
</pre>

It&#39;s up to me to ensure that the first value is less than the last one, and I&#39;m going to ignore matters of case for this example:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 words.p6 --first=fox --last=hound
fox
foxbane
foxberry
foxchop
...
Houghton
hounce
hound
</pre>

I can specify the same word for the start and end. When the particular word shows up, the flip-flop evaluates the lefthand side. Since it&#39;s the same word, the flip-flop turns on.

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 words.p6 --first=fox --last=fox
fox
</pre>

I still have to read all the lines in this example, but there it is.

The flip-flop has inclusive and exclusive versions, just like the ranges and sequences I wrote about in <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/2016/11/18/quick-tip-3-inclusive-and-exclusive/">Quick Tip #3: Inclusive and Exclusive</a>. I can exclude either endpoint with a <code>^</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub MAIN (
	Str :$file  = &#39;/usr/share/dict/words&#39;,
	Str :$first!,
	Str :$last!,
	) {
	my $fh = open( $file );

	for $fh.lines -&gt; $line {
		say $line if $line ~~ $first ^ff^ $line ~~ $last; # changed!
		}
	}
</pre>

Now I don&#39;t see &quot;fox&quot; or &quot;hound&quot; in the output:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 words.p6 --first=fox --last=hound
foxbane
foxberry
foxchop
...
Houghton
hounce
</pre>

In that example I excluded both endpoints with <code>^ff^</code>, but I can exclude either side on their own with <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_^ff">^ff</a></code> or <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_ff^">ff^</a></code>.

But, I don&#39;t have to be satisfied with one window. I can put <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction">Junctions</a> into <code>$first</code> and <code>$last</code> to make multiple windows. Any of the values in <code>$first</code> can turn it on and any of the values in <code>$last</code> can turn it off.

<pre class="brush:perl">
sub MAIN (
	Str :$file  = &#39;/usr/share/dict/words&#39;,
	) {
	my $fh = open( $file );

	my $first = any( &lt;cat fox&gt; );
	my $last  = any( &lt;dog hound&gt; );

	for $fh.lines -&gt; $line {
		say $line if $line ~~ $first ff $line ~~ $last;
		}
	}
</pre>

Now I see that it turns off at &quot;dog&quot; but turns on again at &quot;fox&quot;:

<pre class="brush:perl">
cat
catabaptist
catabases
...
doffer
doftberry
dog
fox
foxbane
foxberry
...
houghmagandy
Houghton
hounce
</pre>

If you&#39;re used to the sed version of flip-flopping, there&#39;s also <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_fff">fff</a></code>. This one doesn&#39;t evaluate both sides for the same element.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a really <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/category/kickstarter-tips/">Quick Tip</a>. It&#39;s about the Schwartzian Transform, which makes things quicker. <!--more-->

You may have seen my presentation from the <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/alpineperl2016/">Alpine Perl Workshop 2016</a>. I talked abou the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brian_d_foy/the-surprisingly-tense-history-of-the-schwartzian-transform">surprisingly tense history of the Schwartzian Transform</a>. I also <a href="http://perltricks.com/article/the-history-of-the-schwartzian-transform/">wrote about it for PerlTricks</a>.

In short, Randal didn&#39;t invent it but he made it popular. The popularity wasn&#39;t immediate though.

In Perl 5 that looks like this map-sort-map:

<pre class="brush:plain">
print
  map { $_-&gt;[0] }
  sort { $a-&gt;[1] <=> $b-&gt;[1] }
  map { [$_, lc] }
  &lt;&gt;;
</=></pre>

The trick is to reduce the number of time you call <code>lc</code>. There&#39;s no need to call it over and over on the same string.

How would you do the same thing in Perl 6?

First, Perl 6 has a unary version of <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/sort#(Any)_method_sort">sort</a></code>. I tell it how to make a value then it does that for each pair of elements to compare:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @sorted_words = sort { .lc }, @words;
</pre>

It takes two elements from the list, lowercases both of them, and compares them with string equality (cmp). You don&#39;t have to type out the <code>.lc</code> twice. This doesn&#39;t transform the elements, so the output list isn&#39;t necessarily all lowercase. It&#39;s the original list but possibly re-ordered.

Not only that, sort caches the result of the operation so it doesn&#39;t have to redo it. That is, Perl 6 already does what the Schwartzian Transform was doing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <code>p6doc</code> command helps you read the Perl 6 docs. It&#39;s in the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc">Perl 6 documentation repo</a> (so, it doesn&#39;t come with Rakudo). <!--more-->


Check out the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc">repo</a> and from within that directory install it with zef:

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ zef --depsonly install . 
</pre>

From there you should have to <code>p6doc</code> command. Run it to see what it can do:

<pre class="brush:plain">
What documentation do you want to read?
Examples: p6doc Str
          p6doc Str.split
          p6doc faq

You can list some top level documents:
          p6doc -l

You can also look up specific method/routine definitions:
          p6doc -f push

You can bypass the pager and print straight to stdout:
          p6doc -n Str
</pre>

Now, a word of caution here. Perl 6 has lots of undocumented bits and not everything works yet. But, you can help by sending pull requests. The <code>-l</code> lists the top-level pages it knows about:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ p6doc -l
5to6-nutshell
5to6-perlfunc
5to6-perlop
5to6-perlsyn
5to6-perlvar
AST
Any
Array
Associative
Attribute
Backtrace
Bag
...
unicode_entry
unicode_texas
variables
</pre>

I can read the docs from the command line:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ p6doc Str
TITLE
class Str

SUBTITLE
String of characters

    class Str is Cool does Stringy { }

Built-in class for strings. Objects of type Str are immutable.

Methods

  routine chop

    multi sub    chop(Str:D)  returns Str:D
    multi method chop(Str:D: $chars = 1) returns Str:D

Returns the string with $chars characters removed from the end.

  routine chomp

Defined as:

    multi sub    chomp(Str:D ) returns Str:D
    multi method chomp(Str:D:) returns Str:D
</pre>


But, this is 2016. Let&#39;s read it in the browser. First, from the directory, create the HTML files. This might take awhile (a long, long time), but you can read the same docs on <a href="http://docs.perl6.org">docs.perl6.org</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ make html
</pre>


Then, run the web app to serve it all. That&#39;s a <a href="http://www.mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a> app, so you&#39;re throwing Perl 5 a bone.

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ make run
Starting local server…
perl5.24.0 app.pl daemon
[Tue Dec  6 11:18:29 2016] [debug] Install Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack to enable SASS processor. You will also need CSS::Sass module or have `sass` command working

		<title>Quick Tip #26: Keep just the good parts</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/12/11/quick-tip-26-keep-just-the-good-parts/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 12:11:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Ever wanted to break up a string based on the parts that you wanted to keep? You probably already know about <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/split">split</a></code>; it uses a pattern to find the parts to discard. Perl 6&#39;s <code><a comb" docs.perl6.org hre"https: routine>comb</a></code> uses a pattern to find the parts of a string it keeps. <!--more-->

Suppose you want to keep all the words, which for this example you consider that to mean groups of non-whitespace. The pattern you want to keep is <code>/ \S+ /</code> (remember that patterns have insignificant). Here&#39;s what that could look like in the REPL:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type &#39;exit&#39; or &#39;^D&#39;
&gt; $_ = &#39;Hamadryas chloe&#39;
Hamadryas chloe
&gt; .comb( /\S+/ )  # operates on $_ by default
(Hamadryas chloe)
&gt; .comb( /\S+/ ).elems
2
</pre>

That doesn&#39;t look much different than the string you started with even though it is now two elements. The REPL prints out what it considers to be a nicely formatted string, but sometimes that&#39;s confusing. You could look at it with <code>.perl</code> instead:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; .comb( /\S+/ ).perl
(&quot;Hamadryas&quot;, &quot;chloe&quot;).Seq
</pre>

Now you see the two elements. However, there&#39;s a more interesting way to do this. You can use the <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/fmt">fmt</a></code> method on a list. It will apply its template to each item in the list. You can easily surround each word with braces, for example:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; .comb( /\S+/ ).fmt( &#39;{%s}&#39; )
{Hamadryas} {chloe}
</pre>

Now you can see which parts of the string belong to which element. This feature pleases me more and more each time I use it. Even though you could do this with a <code>map</code>, this is so much easier.

Try it on this string to extract the species from these scientific names. The <code>&lt;?after ...</code> is a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Lookbehind_assertions">lookbehind assertion</a> that says that pattern has to come before the part the matches. But, it matches a condition at a particular point of the string instead of matching characters so that part is part of what <code>comb</code> keeps:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; $_ = &#39;Hamadryas chloe, Hamadryas epinome, Hamadryas laodamia&#39;
Hamadryas chloe, Hamadryas epinome, Hamadryas laodamia
&gt; .comb( /&lt;?after Hamadryas \s+&gt; &lt;[a..z]&gt;+/ )
(chloe epinome laodamia)
&gt; .comb( /&lt;?after Hamadryas \s+&gt; &lt;[a..z]&gt;+/ ).fmt( &#39;{%s}&#39; )
{chloe} {epinome} {laodamia}
</pre>

Here&#39;s something a bit more complicated (and contrived even). Make a pattern to grab the items out of a list separated by commas with a final <code>and</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; $_ = &#39;Daphnaeae, Epimeliades, Kissiae, and Meliae&#39;
Daphnaeae, Epimeliades, Kissiae, and Meliae
&gt; .comb( rx:i/ &lt;[a..z]&gt;+ &lt;?before [\, \s+ [and \s+]? | $ ]&gt; / )
(Daphnaeae Epimeliades Kissiae Meliae)
</pre>

There&#39;s a lookahead assertion that looks for a &quot;comma whitespace with optional and&quot; or the end of string. I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to work this out for styles that (mistakenly) eschew the Oxford comma.

It&#39;s probably easier to split on the separators in this case, but you&#39;re playing with <code>comb</code> in this tip. You&#39;ll appreciate this more when the parts separating the good bits are more complicated to match than the other way around.

And, for a final tip, <code>comb</code> with no pattern splits into characters:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; .comb
(D a p h n a e a e ,   E p i m e l i a d e s ,   K i s s i a e ,   a n d   M e l i a e)
</pre>]]></description>

		<title>Quick Tip #25: Very literal Quoting</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/12/10/quick-tip-25-very-literal-quoting/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2016 09:02:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has a basic <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/quoting">quoting mechanism</a> that is as literal as it can be. It doesn&#39;t escape anything and doesn&#39;t interpolate anything. The <code>Q</code> does nothing special so you get a string as close to exactly what you see: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; Q/Single quote delimiter with \/; # no escaping
Single quote delimiter with \
&gt; Q/This is about $var./ # no interpolation
This is about $var.
&gt; Q&quot;This is still about $var.&quot; # still no interpolation
This is still about $var.
&gt; Q&quot;C:\\This\is\a\path&quot; # no \ proliferation!
C:\\This\is\a\path
</pre>

It does have on interesting feature. It knows how to count balanced delimiters. If I use one of the paired characters, I can have the opening version in the literal string as long as the open and closing bits are balanced (so, every opener has a closer):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; Q&lt; I have some &lt;&lt; inside &gt;&gt; &gt;
 I have some &lt;&lt; inside &gt;&gt;
</pre>

If I don&#39;t have balanced thingys, I have a problem:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; Q&lt; I have some &lt;&lt; inside  &gt;
===SORRY!=== Error while compiling:
Couldn&#39;t find terminator &gt; (corresponding &lt; was at line 1)
at line 2
------&gt; &lt;BOL&gt;⏏&lt;I EOL&gt;
    expecting any of:
        &gt;
</pre>

I wouldn&#39;t recommend this, though, because I can choose many other delimiters:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; Q🐱I have some &gt;&gt; inside🐱
I have some &gt;&gt; inside
</pre>

I can&#39;t use anything I like as a delimiter, though, and some of the exclusions may surprise you:

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Prohibited</th>
	<th>Reason</th>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td><code>#</code></td>
	<td>start of a comment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>(</code></td>
	<td>Looks like a function call</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>:</code></td>
	<td>Starts an adverb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>&#39;</code></td>
	<td>Identifier character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>-</code></td>
	<td>Identifier character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>word characters</td>
	<td>Because that&#39;s crazy</td>
</tr>
</table>

The rest of the quoting mechanisms build up from there. Other quoting forms have their own operators, such as <code>q//</code> for single quoting with limited escaping and qq// for double quoting with interpolation. The <code>Q</code> can handle them will an adverb:

<pre class="brush:plain">
q/This has a backslash \n/
Q:q//This has a backslash \n/
qq/This and a newline \n/
Q:qq/This and a newline \n/
</pre>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can use P6&#39;s <a href="/2016/11/30/quick-tip-15-phasers/">phasers</a> to track how my program moves from one phase to the next. In particular, I&#39;m curious about how much time my program spends in the compile-phase. P6 might be a bit slow now, or at least slower than you think it should be, but that&#39;s okay. The core developers want to be correct first and fast second (but, also both). If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/ChangeLog">Rakudo change logs</a>, you see lots of entries mentioning big speedups in things they got working first and are now optimizing. <!--more-->

Here I use <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>INIT</code>, although I leave off their braces. In the first <code>put</code> I concatenate a result with its label. In the second <code>put</code>, I interpolate a result into a string by placing code in braces in the string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
put &quot;Compile to run time: &quot; ~ INIT now - BEGIN now;
sleep 3;
put &quot;Run time to finish: { now - INIT now }&quot;;
</pre>

I see that the compile time isn&#39;t that bad (it&#39;s not humanly noticeable in this program):

<pre class="brush:plain">
Compile to run time: 0.03161371
Run time to finish: 3.00564300
</pre>

You might think its weird that those numbers come out like that when it looks like some things happen earlier than the statement that creates them. I can expand the example to see that the phasers fire before the statements that contain them:

<pre class="brush:plain">
INIT { put &quot;Starting run time at { now }&quot; }
END  { put &quot;Ending at { now }&quot; }

put &quot;Compile to run time: &quot; ~
	INIT { put &quot;INIT in run time message { now }&quot;; now } \ # unspace!
		-
	BEGIN { put &quot;BEGIN in run time message { now }&quot;; now }
	;
sleep 3;
put &quot;Run time to finish: {
	now - INIT { put &quot;INIT in finish message { now }&quot;; now }
	}&quot;;
</pre>

You can see that <code>now</code> creates an <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Instant">Instant</a> object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
BEGIN in run time message Instant:1481307679.940645
Starting run time at Instant:1481307679.995588
INIT in run time message Instant:1481307679.996641
INIT in finish message Instant:1481307679.998188
Compile to run time: 0.0538441
Run time to finish: 3.0023635
Ending at Instant:1481307683.004673
</pre>

I wanted to check how much of a hit I take by <a href="/2016/12/07/quick-tip-22-use-perl-5-modules-in-perl-6/">loading a Perl 5 module</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use Business::ISBN:from&lt;Perl5&gt;;

my $isbn = Business::ISBN.new( &#39;9781491954324&#39; );
put &quot;ISBN: &quot;, $isbn.as_string;

put &quot;Compile to run time: &quot; ~ INIT now - BEGIN now;
sleep 3;
put &quot;Run time to finish: { now - INIT now }&quot;;
</pre>

The results are much better than I thought. Even loading a file from a foreign language is quick. It&#39;s not even noticeable:

<pre class="brush:plain">
ISBN: 978-1-4919-5432-4
Compile to run time: 0.0359533
Run time to finish: 3.0084209
</pre>

If I loaded a different, more complicated module these result may be different. But, I was interested if there was a penalty for loading any module. I don&#39;t see it.]]></description>

		<pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2016 17:37:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has always had a goal of interacting with other languages. When Larry Wall announced the project in 2000, he talked about <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/10/23/soto2000.html">translate with 95-percent accuracy 95 percent of the scripts</a>. He wanted a way to run Perl 5 from Perl 6. <!--more-->


And, with <a href="https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5">Inline::Perl5</a>, you can do that. Most notably, you can load Perl 5 modules:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;
use Inline::Perl5;
use Business::ISBN:from&lt;Perl5&gt;;

my $isbn = Business::ISBN.new( &#39;9781491954324&#39; );

say $isbn.as_isbn10.as_string;
</pre>

In the authority section of the module, I specified <code>from&lt;Perl5&gt;</code>. To make this work, you need to compile <code>perl</code> as specified in the <a href="https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/blob/master/README.md">Inline::Perl5 README.md</a>. You need a <code>perl</code> compiled with <code>-Duseshrplib</code>; I had to compile a new <code>perl</code> but that wasn&#39;t a big deal.

If you are using a recent Rakudo and you&#39;ve already installed <a href="https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5">Inline::Perl5</a>, that module loads implicitly:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;
use Business::ISBN:from&lt;Perl5&gt;;

my $isbn = Business::ISBN.new( &#39;9781491954324&#39; );

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#39;s think about numbers. I&#39;ve been inserting Kickstarter messages into my Quick Tips, but this post is <i>about</i> Kickstarter. Or, about their mistreatment of numbers. There&#39;s no scandal, just those little inconsistencies that the experienced programmer notices because they have made the same mistakes. Perl 6 has features to make this easier. <!--more-->

First, here&#39;s the current state of <a href="http://kck.st/2fYlzB2">my Kickstarter campaign</a> for the <i>Learning Perl 6</i> book. The first image is from the daily email they send me and the second is the dashboard on the website.

The metrics aren&#39;t from the same instant, as you see from looking at the number of backers and the funding level. But, notice that the higher amount and higher backers has the lower percentage. Most of you probably immediately recognize this as two different strategies in turning Real numbers in Integers.

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Funding</th>
	<th>Goal</th>
	<th>Decimal</th>
	<th>Reported</th>
	<th>Method</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>36,254</td>
	<td>37,000</td>
	<td>0.97983783783</td>
	<td>97</td>
	<td>Truncating</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>36,088</td>
	<td>37,000</td>
	<td>0.97535135135</td>
	<td>98</td>
	<td>Rounding</td>
</tr>
</table>

These differences seem small, but for the person running the campaign they can provide a moment of panic. If I see the higher percentage first then see the lower percentage, I wonder if people cancelled or adjusted their pledge. This is especially troubling when you get close to the end of a campaign because there are <a href="http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2013/11/26152-kickstarter-backer-allegedly-scams-one-hundred-projects/">bad actors out there you like to give you that last little bit then dispute the charge later</a> (and Kickstarter then charges my credit card to pay them back). And, there are plenty of Kickstarter spammers who back your project hoping you&#39;ll back theirs, then cancel their pledge when you don&#39;t. I know, weird.

Your pledge is just that. No money changes hands until the pledge total goes over the minimum funding. I haven&#39;t captured any of that money, and I only expect to get about 90% of it through various credit card issues once Kickstarter collects in about two weeks.

But, back to programming. When you see two different ways of getting the same number, you know you have a code smell. We know that there should be a common routine that handles it. It seems simple to divide two numbers, but obviously it isn&#39;t. There are other things, like normalization, that come into play.

Let&#39;s divide some numbers in Perl 6. First, there&#39;s the division operator and it might look like it divides two numbers. If I look at the type of thingy in <code>$n</code>, I see that it&#39;s a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> (rational number). If I look at the <code>.perl</code> representation, I see a fraction (in this case reduced):

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ perl6
To exit type &#39;exit&#39; or &#39;^D&#39;
&gt; my $n = 36088 / 37000
0.975351
&gt; $n.WHAT
(Rat)
&gt; $n.perl
&lt;4511/4625&gt;
</pre>

That is, Perl 6 delays my decision to represent this number because it knows where I started. It doesn&#39;t lose bits or accuracy because it allows a series of inexact operations. Perl 6 knows the numerator and denominator still.

I can represent the number as a whole number percentage in two ways. Perl 6&#39;s Real class has methods to <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Real#method_truncate">truncate</a> and <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Real#method_round">round</a>:

<pre class="brush:perl">
&gt; ($n * 100).truncate
97
&gt; ($n * 100).round
98
</pre>

But, I don&#39;t want to make that decision everywhere in the code. If I were doing this, I would recognize the logical task. I want to pass in the numbers and get the same thing out every time. I can define a subroutine to do that:

<pre class="brush:perl">
&gt; sub show_funding_percentage ( Rat $funding --&gt; Int ) {
* ($funding * 100).round }
sub show_funding_percentage (Rat $funding --&gt; Int) { #`(Sub+{Callable[Int]}|140349924897624) ... }
&gt; show_funding_percentage( $n )
98
</pre>

The trick is making your programmers use the proper interface rather than thinking they know better because division is simple. Showing the funding percentage is a logical task. Other things might need to happen. I shouldn&#39;t have to think about all the steps to get there every time I want to use it.

That&#39;s within one language though. There&#39;s another issue that could be at play. Different languages or libraries might be in the path to the website and the path to email. They get the same inputs but they produce different outputs. There are different rounding strategies; it&#39;s not the simple rules you learned in grade school. In this case I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the problem because most strategies round these two numbers the same way.

As a final note, consider what else rational numbers give us. We&#39;re mostly used to inexact numbers due to the limitations of floating point numbers. With rationals, which are two integers, that isn&#39;t a problem:

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ perl5 -e &#39;print +(0.1+0.1+0.1)==0.3 ? &quot;True&quot; : &quot;False&quot;&#39;
False
$ perl6 -e &#39;say (0.1+0.1+0.1)==0.3&#39;
True
</pre>

Or, I should say, it&#39;s not a problem until I make it one. I can turn a rational number into a string (<code>$s</code>) and turn that string back into a number (<code>$t</code>). I&#39;ve now lost some precision. When I multiply by what I think is the denominator, I don&#39;t get back the right numerator:

<pre class="brush:perl">
&gt; my $s = ~$n
0.975351
&gt; $s.WHAT
(Str)
&gt; my $t = +$s;
0.975351
&gt; $t.WHAT
(Rat)
&gt; $t.perl
0.975351
&gt; $t*37000
36087.987
</pre>

And, we know what that small round errors lead to bigger problems.

		<title>Quick Tip #20: Way off base</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Want to use numbers that are represented in something other than base 10? That&#39;s no problem in Perl 6. Some languages throw you a bone with binary, octal, or hexadecimal conversions, but what if you want base 17? Or, better yet, base 36?  <!--more-->

First, for <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Real">Real numbers</a> (or, non-complex numbers), I have the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Real#method_base">base</a> command:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; 137.base(2)
10001001
&gt; 137.base(8)
211
&gt; 137.base(16)
89
&gt; 137.base(36)
3T
</pre>

I can go up to base-36 because that&#39;s how many digits and Latin letters the method uses. Those convert number types to strings.

I can go the other way too. The <code>:DIGIT(string)</code> syntax converts strings to numbers:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; :2(&#39;10001001&#39;)
137
&gt; :8(&#39;211&#39;)
137
&gt; :16(&#39;89&#39;)
137
</pre>

These assume that the string is a number represented that the radix after the colon. These return a Perl 6 number, which you can display in any base that you like.

From there I can make some one-liners to convert bases. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2842150/2766176">I&#39;ve done this for Perl 5</a>, and now I have them for Perl 6:

<pre class="brush:plain">
alias o2b=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf q/:2(%b)/, :8(@*ARGS.shift)&#39;&quot;
alias o2d=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf q/:10(%d)/, :8(@*ARGS.shift)&#39;&quot;
alias o2h=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf q/:16(%x)/, :8(@*ARGS.shift)&#39;&quot;

alias d2b=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf  q/:2(%b)/, @*ARGS.shift&#39;&quot;
alias d2o=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf  q/:8(%d)/, @*ARGS.shift&#39;&quot;
alias d2h=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf q/:16(%x)/, @*ARGS.shift&#39;&quot;

alias h2b=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf  q/:2(%b)/, :16(@*ARGS.shift)&#39;&quot;

alias h2d=&quot;perl6 -e &#39;say sprintf q/:10(%d)/, :16(@*ARGS.shift)&#39;&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 lets you constrain variable values with types, but you don&#39;t have to limit yourself to the built-in types. Once defined, these act like the built-in types. Here are some subsets I&#39;ve stolen from Brad Clawsie&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/bradclawsie/Subsets-Common">Subsets::Common</a> module: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
my package EXPORT::DEFAULT {
	...
	subset Pos of Numeric where * &gt; 0;
	subset Neg of Numeric where * <0; * 0; numeric of subset unumeric where zero>= 0;

	subset Even of Int where * % 2 == 0;
	subset Odd  of Int where * % 2;

	subset Time::Hour12 of PosInt where * ~~ 1 .. 12;
	subset Time::Hour24 of Int    where * ~~ 0 .. 23;
	subset Time::Minute of Int    where * ~~ 0 .. 59;
	subset Time::Second of Int    where * ~~ 0 .. 59;
	...
}
</0;></pre>

The <code>subset</code> started the declaration and is followed by the name you want for the new type. This is a subset because you base it on an existing type that you declare with <code>of</code>. After that, you can use a <code>where</code> clause to refine your new type.

And, Brad put these in a package where he declared that everything is exported.

Here&#39;s one that I created for my Perl 6 version of <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-chemistry-elements">Chemistry::Elements</a>. Don&#39;t worry so much about what&#39;s in the code; think more about the ability to have any code you need to decide if the value fits the constraint that you like. Here&#39;s the type I defined to constrain an integer to a known atomic number (typically called Z from the German word <i>Zahl</i>, as in <i>Atomzahl</i>):

<pre class="brush:plain">
	subset ZInt of Cool is export where {
		state ( $min, $max ) = %names.keys.sort( { $^a <=> $^b } ).[0,*-1];
		( $_.truncate == $_ and $min &lt;= $_ &lt;= $max )
			or
		note &quot;Expected a known atomic number between $min and $max, but got $_&quot;
			and
		False;
		};
</=></pre>

For my subset, I exported it by declaring it <code>is export</code> so other people using the module could use the type outside of my module. Most notably (heh), I can give a specific error message when the value doesn&#39;t match.]]></description>

		<title>Quick Tip #18: Short circuit subroutines with multi</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/12/03/quick-tip-18-short-circuit-subroutines-with-multi/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2016 16:15:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/2016/12/02/quick-tip-17-rakudos-built-in-profiler/">yesterday&#39;s Quick Tip</a> I used the Fibonacci sequence as an example to show off Rakudo&#39;s <code>--profile</code> option. In today&#39;s tip I&#39;ll use that same sequence to show off Perl 6&#39;s multi-dispatch features. <!--more-->

Consider the situation where I have an out-of-control subroutine. The one I&#39;m about to show is not really going crazy, but I&#39;ve programmed it in such a way that for moderately low input values it becomes unusable:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub fib_recursive ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state $called = 0;
	$called++;
	END { say &quot;fib_recursive was called $called times&quot; }
	note &quot;Called with $n&quot;;
	return 1 if $n <2; "$n $n ( ) * + - -1} 1 2 and calling fib_recursive( int main note return sub where with {$n {$n-2}"; }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	say fib_recursive( $n );
	}
</2;></pre>

I&#39;ve added some calls to <code>note</code> so I can watch the progress:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 fibonacci.p6 5
Called with 5
5 calling with 4 and 3
Called with 4
4 calling with 3 and 2
Called with 3
3 calling with 2 and 1
Called with 2
2 calling with 1 and 0
Called with 1
Called with 0
Called with 1
Called with 2
2 calling with 1 and 0
Called with 1
Called with 0
Called with 3
3 calling with 2 and 1
Called with 2
2 calling with 1 and 0
Called with 1
Called with 0
Called with 1
8
fib_recursive was called 15 times
</pre>

If I map this out to call levels, I get something like this to explain the calls. Each level of indentation is a call level:

<pre class="brush:plain">
5
	4
		3
			2
				1
				0
			1
		2
			1
			0
	3
		2
			1
			0
		1
</pre>

The <code>note</code> routine sends its output to standard error. If I don&#39;t want those extra messages, I can redirect standard error to something else:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 fibonacci.p6 5 2&gt; /dev/null
8
fib_recursive was called 15 times
</pre>

So far so good. I get the answer quickly enough that I don&#39;t care how long it took. However, as the argument&#39;s value increases, the slower and slower my program gets. The number of times I call the routine explodes as the number goes up. I&#39;ll leave this as an exercise for the reader, but the number of calls follows the sequence <i>F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) + 1</i>. That <i>+1</i> is a sly way of saying that the number of recursive calls grows faster than the coresponding value in the Fibonacci sequence.

You may have heard (or read) me rant on this before, but this is what happens to languages that can&#39;t do tail-call optimization. Perl 6 doesn&#39;t know what subroutine it might call to get the next values, so it can&#39;t turn this recursive algorithm into an iterative one. Some languages can optimize the literal source code into something much better, and that&#39;s why you see examples like this. But I could spend all day talking about this (and do in my <a href="https://www.masteringperl.org">Mastering Perl</a> class). The short answer is &quot;Don&#39;t do that.&quot;

In this post, I&#39;m not going to rewrite the subroutine as something better. I&#39;m going to short-circuit it by define a new subroutine with the same name that handles particular cases.

Before I start, I want to see the Fibonacci sequence. In the Perl 6 REPL, I&#39;ll slice an infinite lazy sequence:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; (1,1, *+* ... * )[0..30];
(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765 10946 17711 28657 46368 75025 121393 196418 317811 514229 832040 1346269)
</pre>

And here&#39;s the number of calls to <code>fib_recursive</code> I have to make to get those numbers:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; (1,1, *+*+1 ... * )[0..30]
(1 1 3 5 9 15 25 41 67 109 177 287 465 753 1219 1973 3193 5167 8361 13529 21891 35421 57313 92735 150049 242785 392835 635621 1028457 1664079 2692537)
</pre>

Oh, too hard to line up the values? Here&#39;s a double zip (using the Z operator) of the sequence number, Fibonacci number, and subroutine call count:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; ( 0 .. 30 ) Z (1,1, *+* ... * )[0..30] Z (1,1, *+*+1 ... * )[0..30]
((0 1 1) (1 1 1) (2 2 3) (3 3 5) (4 5 9) (5 8 15) (6 13 25) (7 21 41) (8 34 67) (9 55 109) (10 89 177) (11 144 287) (12 233 465) (13 377 753) (14 610 1219) (15 987 1973) (16 1597 3193) (17 2584 5167) (18 4181 8361) (19 6765 13529) (20 10946 21891) (21 17711 35421) (22 28657 57313) (23 46368 92735) (24 75025 150049) (25 121393 242785) (26 196418 392835) (27 317811 635621) (28 514229 1028457) (29 832040 1664079) (30 1346269 2692537))
</pre>

All those years you made fun of Lisp...

I now know these numbers and I can use this knowledge in my program so avoid computation. I&#39;ll create a multi-sub that immediately returns the value for <i>n = 25</i>. I can see in that list that I would save 242,785 subroutine calls every time I&#39;d call fib_recursive( 25 ):

In Perl 6, I can have multiple definitions of a subroutine if I give them different signatures. When I call the subroutine, Perl 6 will look through the list of definitions and use the first one that fits the argument list.

The special technique here is that I use a literal value in the signature. When the value of the argument is 25, that&#39;s the subroutine Perl 6 will call:

<pre class="brush:plain">
# define first! Perl 6 looks in the order of definition!
multi fib_recursive ( 25 ) { 121393 }

# multi implies &quot;sub&quot;, but you can write &quot;multi sub&quot; if you like
multi fib_recursive ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state $called = 0;
	$called++;
	END { say &quot;fib_recursive was called $called times&quot; }
	note &quot;Called with $n&quot;;
	return 1 if $n <2; "$n $n ( ) * + - -1} 1 2 and calling fib_recursive( int main note return sub where with {$n {$n-2}"; }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	say fib_recursive( $n );
	}
</2;></pre>

When I call it with 25 now, I immediately get the answer. The <code>END</code> block still runs and doesn&#39;t have a value for <code>$count</code> because I never ran the other subroutine definition:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 fibonacci.p6 25 2&gt; /dev/null
121393
fib_recursive was called  times
</pre>

When I run it with 26, I see that <code>fib_recursive</code> runs 150,050 times. From the sequence I generated earlier, I would have had to run it 392,835 times with the pure recursive solution. The difference of 392,835 and 150,050 is 242,785. That&#39;s the number of calls from the 25 branch!

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 fibonacci.p6 26 2&gt; /dev/null
196418
fib_recursive was called 150050 times
</pre>

I saved some time there, but let&#39;s go one better. I could have saved more by defining three multis. To really short-circuit the sequence, I need to short circuit the <i>n-1</i> and <i>n-2</i> branches. I define another multi with the literal value of 24:

<pre class="brush:plain">
multi fib_recursive ( 24 ) {  75025 }
multi fib_recursive ( 25 ) { 121393 }

multi fib_recursive ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state $called = 0;
	$called++;
	END { say &quot;fib_recursive was called $called times&quot; }
	note &quot;Called with $n&quot;;
	return 1 if $n <2; "$n $n ( ) * + - -1} 1 2 and calling fib_recursive( int main note return sub where with {$n {$n-2}"; }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	say fib_recursive( $n );
	}
</2;></pre>

When I try it with 26 now, I call the actually-recursing <code>fib_recursive</code> exactly once. That calls the two multis for <code>fib_recursive(25)</code> and <code>fib_recursive(24)</code>, which immediately return values:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 fibonacci.p6 26 2&gt; /dev/null
196418
fib_recursive was called 1 times
</pre>

In this example, I&#39;ve saved time because I had some precomputed values. The problem is as complex as when I started. It&#39;s not a better algorithm, really. It&#39;s just cheating a bit.

Consider a different way to use this same technique that changes the complexity. I won&#39;t write real code here, but I want to illustrate another use of this technique.

Suppose that I have a general subroutine that works in most cases, but there are a few special cases that could make the code really complicated. Handling the special cases requires a lot of structure. Let the multi subs handle that structure for you, perhaps calling common subroutines as needed:

<pre class="brush:plain">
multi open_for_business ( Date $d where *.is-a-federal-holiday ) { ... }
multi open_for_business ( Date $d where *.is-a-weekend ) { ... }
multi open_for_business ( Date $d ) { ... }
</pre>

I could also use this for debugging where I know I have one case that I want to inspect while not seeing debugging output from the other cases.]]></description>

Let&#39;s write some routines to do Fibonacci numbers, which seem to be most authors&#39; favorite example for this sort of thing. Indeed, I used it in the &quot;Benchmarking&quot; chapter of <a href="http://www.masteringperl.org">Mastering Perl</a>, but mostly to point out how wrong the simple benchmarks were.

I&#39;ll implement it in four ways, none of which I claim to be the best:

<ul>
<li>The recursive way you see in most examples
</li><li>A recursive fashion with memoization
</li><li>Using the sequence operator
</li><li>Using memoization with an iterative approach.
</li></ul>

In <a href="http://www.masteringperl.org">Mastering Perl</a>, I presented a few arguments that escape the usual discussion:

<ul>
<li>The routine that runs fastest the first time isn&#39;t necessarily the best
</li><li>Caching results you&#39;ll use again eventually pays off in time
</li><li>Using less time usually means using less memory
</li><li>You improve with better algorithms instead of different syntax.
</li></ul>

Here are some implementations in Perl 6, where I didn&#39;t try at all to make them efficient. I merely want something to show the workings of the profiler:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub fib_recursive ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	return 1 if $n <2; $n ( ) * + - 1 2 fib_recursive( fib_recursive_memoize int return sub where }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state @n = ( 1, 1 );

	return @n[$n] if $n <@n.elems; $n ( ) * + - 1 2 @n[$n]="fib_recursive_memoize(" fib_recursive_memoize( fib_sequence int return sub where }>= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	my $seq := 1, 1, * + * ... *;
	$seq[$n]
	}

sub fib_memoize ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	state @n = ( 1, 1 );
	return @n[$n] if $n <@n.elems; $n - .. @n.elems for> $index {
		@n[$index] = @n[$index-1] + @n[$index-2];
		}

	@n[*-1]
	}

sub MAIN ( Int $n where * &gt;= 0 --&gt; Int ) {
	for 1 .. 10 {
		say fib_recursive( $n );
		say fib_recursive_memoize( $n );
		say fib_sequence( $n );
		say fib_memoize( $n );
		}
	}
</@n.elems;></@n.elems;></2;></pre>

I run this program under the profiler, and if I&#39;ve everything correctly, I should see the same number output several times. Or, I&#39;ve done it wrong the same way each time.

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ perl6 --profile fib.p6 20
10946
10946
.....
10946
10946
Writing profiler output to profile-1480712222.02931.html
</pre>

If you don&#39;t like that filename, you can choose your own:

<pre class="brush:perl">
$ perl6 --profile --profile-filename=fibonacci.html fib.p6 20
10946
10946
.....
10946
10946
Writing profiler output to fibonacci.html
</pre>

I can then look at the profiler output. Here&#39;s a screenshot that shows the time spent in each of the subroutines:

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="250" src="/images/fibonacci_profiler.png" width="500">
</div>
</div>

To see the rest of the report, run the program yourself!

I won&#39;t write too much about interpreting these results, but there are several things you should think about in these sorts of comparisons.

First, test with a variety of values, especially those of vastly different orders of magnitude. The recursive solution might look really fast for small <i>N</i>, but it gets bad very quickly.

Second, test it several times, as I&#39;ve done in this example. Some implementations always take the same amount of time while others get faster and faster. In a program where this level of optimization matters, you&#39;re likely to run the interesting routine several times.

Third, consider a completely different approach than any you see here. The Fibonacci numbers aren&#39;t going to change (neither are the values of other sequences). Why compute them again? Just look them up. (I&#39;ll write more about this tomorrow when <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/2016/12/03/quick-tip-18-short-circuit-subroutines-with-multi/">I use multi subs</a>) Something like Redis can store huge lists without eating all your resources or complicating your program.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has several sophisticated ways to make lists. I was playing with a particular task where I needed combinations for something similar to bin packing.

I have a list of items and I want to combine those into other lists of a particular length. Duplication doesn&#39;t matter (so, not sets), although later I&#39;ll want to filter the lists on some utility function. That&#39;s not the interesting bit. <!--more-->

Create a list, and specify a length. Imagine a loop where the length gets bigger:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; my @n = &lt;1 2 3&gt;;
[1 2 3]
&gt; my $n = 4;
4
</pre>

Now for the fancy stuff. The <code>xx</code> replicates the list. It&#39;s not flat. I get a list that has that number of lists. Yep, Perl 6 has proper lists of lists. 

Then, I take that list of lists and reduce it with a cross operator. I end up with a bunch of lists of length <code>$n</code> in all the combinations:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( [X] ( @n xx $n ) )
((1 1 1 1) (1 1 1 2) (1 1 1 3) (1 1 2 1) (1 1 2 2) (1 1 2 3) 
(1 1 3 1) (1 1 3 2) (1 1 3 3) (1 2 1 1) (1 2 1 2) (1 2 1 3) 
(1 2 2 1) (1 2 2 2) (1 2 2 3) (1 2 3 1) (1 2 3 2) (1 2 3 3) 
(1 3 1 1) (1 3 1 2) (1 3 1 3) (1 3 2 1) (1 3 2 2) (1 3 2 3) 
(1 3 3 1) (1 3 3 2) (1 3 3 3) (2 1 1 1) (2 1 1 2) (2 1 1 3) 
(2 1 2 1) (2 1 2 2) (2 1 2 3) (2 1 3 1) (2 1 3 2) (2 1 3 3) 
(2 2 1 1) (2 2 1 2) (2 2 1 3) (2 2 2 1) (2 2 2 2) (2 2 2 3) 
(2 2 3 1) (2 2 3 2) (2 2 3 3) (2 3 1 1) (2 3 1 2) (2 3 1 3) 
(2 3 2 1) (2 3 2 2) (2 3 2 3) (2 3 3 1) (2 3 3 2) (2 3 3 3) 
(3 1 1 1) (3 1 1 2) (3 1 1 3) (3 1 2 1) (3 1 2 2) (3 1 2 3) 
(3 1 3 1) (3 1 3 2) (3 1 3 3) (3 2 1 1) (3 2 1 2) (3 2 1 3) 
(3 2 2 1) (3 2 2 2) (3 2 2 3) (3 2 3 1) (3 2 3 2) (3 2 3 3) 
(3 3 1 1) (3 3 1 2) (3 3 1 3) (3 3 2 1) (3 3 2 2) (3 3 2 3) 
(3 3 3 1) (3 3 3 2) (3 3 3 3))
</pre>

Note that permutations are different, and that&#39;s even easier because there&#39;s a method for that:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; @n.permutations
((1 2 3) (1 3 2) (2 1 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2) (3 2 1))
</pre>

But, let&#39;s do it step by step.

First, I have a list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3)
( 1 2 3 )
</pre>

Now, I want to replicate it. I can do that to get two lists in a bigger list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3) xx 2
((1 2 3) (1 2 3))
</pre>

As a side note, if you don&#39;t like that, you could &quot;de-containerize&quot; (using <code>|</code>) the small list so it loses its structure:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; |(1, 2, 3) xx 2
(1 2 3 1 2 3)
</pre>

I want to keep the structure, however, so I can combine two copies of the list. The next step is a cross. Here I do it by hand:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3) X ( 1, 2, 3 )
((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3))
</pre>

That&#39;s not so bad. The cross makes little lists of the first element of the first list and all the elements of the second list in turn. Then with the second element, and so on. The big list is a bunch of two element little lists.

Now, do that as a reduction. With two lists, it&#39;s the same result:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)
((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3))
</pre>

But, try it with three lists. The lefthand cross gives the result I&#39;ve already shown. There&#39;s one more cross to go. Take the first element, <code>(1, 1)</code> and combine it with <code>1</code> to get <code>(1, 1, 1)</code>. And, do all of those:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1, 2, 3) X ( 1, 2, 3 ) X ( 1, 2, 3 )
...
&gt;  ((1, 1) ... (3, 3))    X ( 1, 2, 3 )
((1 1 1) (1 1 2) ... (3 3 2) (3 3 3))
</pre>

The reduction operator does that for me. It takes two elements, does the operation, and puts the result back on the list. Then it takes that element and the next element and does the operation again. It keeps doing that until there&#39;s one element. I can cross as many times as I like without repeatedly typing it. This is the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] (1, 2, 3), ( 1, 2, 3 ), ( 1, 2, 3 )
...
</pre>

And, I already know how to replicate the list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] (1, 2, 3) xx 3
((1 1 1) (1 1 2) ... (3 3 2) (3 3 3))
</pre>

Now, I put that list in a variable and the count in another variable:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; [X] @n xx $n
( ... )
</pre>

The combinatorial explosion might wreck the computer, but that&#39;s why they make bigger computers. And, later, Perl 6 will let things happen in parallel.

But, I said that I wanted to apply a utility function to these. I can <code>grep</code> those:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( [X] @n xx 5 ).grep( { .sum &gt; 13 } )
((2 3 3 3 3) (3 2 3 3 3) (3 3 2 3 3) (3 3 3 2 3) (3 3 3 3 2) (3 3 3 3 3))
</pre>

But, I can do better than that! Oh yeah, it gets better. I want to partition the big set. I can call <code>categorize</code>. The string I return is which hash key the item &quot;belongs&quot; to. I get a hash back, and each key has an array with the values associated with that key:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( [X] @n xx 5 ).categorize( { .sum &gt; 13 ?? &#39;pass&#39; !! &#39;fail&#39; } )
{fail =&gt; [(1 1 1 1 1) ... (3 3 3 3 1)], pass =&gt; [(2 3 3 3 3) (3 2 3 3 3) (3 3 2 3 3) (3 3 3 2 3) (3 3 3 3 2) (3 3 3 3 3)]}
</pre>

This sort of thing replaces several Perl 5 modules I&#39;ve written where I had to manage arrays of arrays to build tuples.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#39;m working on chapter that I need to turn in to O&#39;Reilly and I keep typing &quot;Perl 6&quot;. It&#39;s annoying. But, what else would I call it? I&#39;m not looking to change the name, just the nickname in the book. <!--more-->

<iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGtq1GlmaAw" width="560"></iframe>

I&#39;m not annoyed because a previous language shares the name. No matter what I think that&#39;s a done deal. I&#39;m more annoyed that it takes some much typing and is repetitive. In <a href="//www.learning-perl.com/">Learning Perl</a>, I often said things like &quot;v5.24 does this&quot; of &quot;v5.10 did that&quot; without saying the magic word. What if I said &quot;v6&quot;? For instance, the sentence, &quot;In v6, the match operator immediately applies the pattern to $_.&quot; 

But, I think that also implies that it&#39;s a change from earlier versions. What about &quot;P6&quot;? It&#39;s the same thing. I could say &quot;QP&quot; for &quot;Quite Perl 6&quot; ;)

I&#39;m talking about the language, not the implementation, so saying &quot;Rakudo&quot;, &quot;Rakudo Star&quot;, &quot;R*&quot; or the like aren&#39;t right.

And, when are we going to get an implementation named Camelia? ;)]]></description>

		<title>Quick Tip #15: Phasers</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/11/30/quick-tip-15-phasers/</link>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has phasers, which are subroutines that run at particular times despite their spatial placement inside the the program text. As a program moves from one thing to another, it might trigger a phaser. I wanted to use a cute title like &quot;Phasers set to stun!&quot;, but <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/day-15-phasers-set-to-stun/">Jonathan Worthington got there first in the 2012 Perl 6 Advent Calendar</a>. (And, tomorrow is the first day of the <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com">2016 Perl 6 Advent Calendar</a>). <!--more-->

For instance, there&#39;s a boundary once the compiler has compiled the program and when the main execution of the program is about to begin. Or, when the program enters or leaves a block.

Here are the <code>NEXT</code> and <code>LAST</code> block phasers:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 3 -&gt; $item {
	put &quot;$item: I&#39;m the last statement in this block&quot;;
	NEXT { say &quot;NEXT: About to move onto next iteration&quot; }
	LAST { say &quot;LAST: I&#39;m not running this block again&quot; }
	}
</pre>

The output shows that the <code>put</code> outputs its message, then the <code>NEXT</code> does. After all the iterations, the <code>LAST</code> runs:

<pre class="brush:plain">
0: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
1: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
2: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
3: I&#39;m the last statement in this block
NEXT: About to move onto next iteration
LAST: I&#39;m not running this block again
</pre>

But, I can rearrange the statements and get the same output:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 3 -&gt; $item {
	LAST { say &quot;LAST: I&#39;m not running this block again&quot; }
	NEXT { say &quot;NEXT: About to move onto next iteration&quot; }
	put &quot;$item: I&#39;m the last statement in this block&quot;;
	}
</pre>

The phasers are attached to Perl 6&#39;s block handling and aren&#39;t really part of the statements inside the block even though that&#39;s where I declared them.

But, since I declared the phasers inside the block, they can bind to variables in that scope. Here I can output a message after the last iteration:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 15 -&gt; $item {
	state $count = 0;
	if $item.is-prime {
		put &quot;$item is prime&quot;;
		$count++;
		}
	LAST { say &quot;There were $count primes&quot; }
	}
</pre>

That&#39;s really cool! I like this much more than adding another, outer scope to handle the variable and the final message:

<pre class="brush:plain">
{
my $count;
for 0 .. 15 -&gt; $item {
	if $item.is-prime {
		put &quot;$item is prime&quot;;
		$count++;
		}
	}
say &quot;There were $count primes&quot;;
}
</pre>

Note that even though the phasers don&#39;t particularly care about their textual position, the compiler needs to have already seen anything you want the phaser to reference. This won&#39;t work because <code>$count</code> doesn&#39;t exist yet:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for 0 .. 15 -&gt; $item {
	LAST { say &quot;There were $count primes&quot; }  # $count not compiled yet
	state $count = 0;
	if $item.is-prime {
		put &quot;$item is prime&quot;;
		$count++;
		}
	}
</pre>


Here&#39;s a program the shows many of the phasers:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

# Program execution
BEGIN  { put &quot;BEGIN, at compile time as soon as possible&quot; }
CHECK  { put &quot;CHECK, at compile time, as late as possible&quot; }
INIT   { put &quot;INIT, during main execution, as soon as possible&quot; }
END    { put &quot;END, during main execution, as late as possible&quot; }

for 0 .. 3 -&gt; $item {
	my Int $square = $item ** 2;

	# Block phasers
	ENTER { say &quot;\tENTER block&quot; }
	LEAVE { say &quot;\tLEAVE block&quot; }
	KEEP  { say &quot;KEEP block: Got value $_&quot;  } # not implemented?
	UNDO  { say &quot;\t\tUNDO block&quot;  }
	PRE   { say &quot;PRE block ------&quot;  } # before running block
	POST  { say &quot;POST block&quot; }        # after running block, before leaving

	# Loop phasers
	FIRST { say &quot;\tFIRST loop&quot; } # first one when beginning looping
	NEXT  { say &quot;\tNEXT loop&quot;  } # last one while looping
	LAST  { say &quot;\tLAST loop&quot;; say &quot;**** LOOP is done ****&quot;  } # last one when done looping
	}

		<title>Quick Tip #13: Kapreker's Constant</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/11/28/quick-tip-13-krapukers-constant/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2016 09:19:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[A Kaprekar&#39;s Constant is the number you end up with when you repeatedly substract the descending digits of a four digit number from the ascending digits. This is mostly a problem with rearranging characters. <!--more-->

Here&#39;s the process:

<ul>
<li>Start with a four digit number that has at least two different digits. Zero-pad if necessary.
</li><li>Get the number formed from the ascending digits, and the number formed from the descending digits.
</li><li>Subtract the ascending from the descending to get the starting number for the next round.
</li><li>Do it again. You shouldn&#39;t have to do this more than seven times.
</li></ul>

Perl 6 has some nice methods in the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str.html">Str</a> class. The <code>comb</code> method turns a string into a list of its characters. Once I have a list, it&#39;s a matter of sorting the digits and putting them back together.

I use the signature for the MAIN subroutine to grab a number from the command line and force it to be in the right range. Perl 6 has the nice syntax to check that a number is between two others that uses the variable once.

I also put the list of digits into a set so I can check if there is more than one thing (set members are unique).

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub MAIN ( Int $n where { 0 &lt; $_ &lt;= 9999 and set( $n.comb ).elems &gt; 1 } ) {
	my $previous = &#39;0000&#39;;

	# pad small numbers with zero to maintain 4 digits in $descending
	# we treat numbers as strings of digits rather than values
	my $next = sprintf &quot;%04d&quot;, $n;

	while ( $next != 0 ) {
		my $descending = $next.comb.sort.reverse.join;
		my $ascending  = $next.comb.sort.join;
		$next = sprintf &quot;%04d&quot;, $descending - $ascending;
		say &quot;$descending - $ascending = $next&quot;;
		last if $next eq $previous;
		$previous = $next;
		}
	}
</pre>

When I run this with a number that fits the conditions, it quickly turns into 6174, and that&#39;s Kaprekar&#39;s Constant:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 kaprekar_numbers.p6 8881
8881 - 1888 = 6993
9963 - 3699 = 6264
6642 - 2466 = 4176
7641 - 1467 = 6174
7641 - 1467 = 6174
</pre>

If I try to pass invalid input, the <code>MAIN</code> doesn&#39;t run. Instead, an implied <code>USAGE</code> spits out a vague message:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 kaprekar_numbers.p6
Usage:
  kaprekar_numbers.p6 &lt;n&gt;
$ perl6 kaprekar_numbers.p6 abc
Usage:
  kaprekar_numbers.p6 &lt;n&gt;
$ perl6 kaprekar_numbers.p6 1
Usage:
  kaprekar_numbers.p6 &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

I could define my own <code>USAGE</code>, but I&#39;ll save that for another Quick Tip.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 uses fancy Unicode characters to do some of its work, but those don&#39;t show up on most keyboards. I like the Mac program <a href="https://earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/">UnicodeChecker</a>. I can search by name, code point, or I can paste a character. I find the one that I want, copy it, and paste it into source. The Windows program <a href="http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html">BabelStine</a> looks similar. Leave me suggestions if you know something for your distro. <!--more-->

<div class="image align">
<div>
<img height="518" src="/images/unicode_checker.png" width="500">
<p class="caption"> UnicodeChecker </p>
</div>
</div>

Or, you can write your own program. Here&#39;s one that takes codepoints and prints their characters (assuming that your terminal is already set up for UTF-8):

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 -e &#39;for @*ARGS { say chr(:16($_)) }&#39; 2150 2153
⅐
⅓
</pre>

The <code>:16()</code> interprets its string argument as base 16. You can convert any base between 2 and 36 that way. 

I can have some command-line aliases:

<pre class="brush:plain">
alias u2char=&#39;perl6 -e &quot;for @*ARGS { say chr(:16(\$_)) }&quot;&#39;

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has a variety of ways to quote things (maybe too many), but they aren&#39;t all the same thing. The angle-bracket quote words, <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> isn&#39;t just <code>qw//</code> written with different characters. It tries to  guess what the words inside the brackets mean. That wasn&#39;t documented today, but <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/fa0b8f643356a3db1e5e59fda4f153f48f90ee90">Zoffix has changed the docs</a> so now it does. <!--more-->

Start with <code>qw//</code>, the basic quotewords operators. It  grabs groups of non-whitespace characters and produces a list of those strings:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; qw{ a b c}.perl
(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
&gt; qw{ a b c}.WHAT
(List)
</pre>

This form doesn&#39;t care what the strings are. Every item comes out a string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; qw{ a b 137}.perl
(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;137&quot;)
&gt; qw{ a b 137}.WHAT
(List)
&gt; qw{ a b 137}.[*-1].perl
&quot;137&quot;
&gt; qw{ a b 137}.[*-1].WHAT
(Str)
</pre>

There&#39;s also a more general quote operator, <code>Q</code>, that can take a <code>:w</code> adverb to do the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; Q:w{ a b 137}.perl
(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;137&quot;)
</pre>

This is mostly what I expect. Everything in the quote words operators come out as the same sort of thing. But note, just because I expect something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s reality. You&#39;ll be much happier with Perl 6 if you don&#39;t expect it to act like some other language named Perl.

<h3>The angle bracket quote words</h3>

The angle bracket form, however, tries to guess what the strings mean. It uses <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/val">val</a> to turn strings that look like numbers into an <i>allomorph</i>. That&#39;s something that can look different but retains its meaning. The idea of the digit 1 is the same as the string &quot;1&quot; and the string &quot;one&quot;, even if Perl 6 decides to represent them as different classes.

<table>

<th>
<tr></tr></th><td><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/IntStr">IntStr</a></td><td>&quot;137&quot;</td><td>Whole numbers</td>
<tr><td><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/NumStr">NumStr</a></td><td>&quot;1.37e2&quot;</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/RatStr">RatStr</a></td><td>&quot;1/137&quot;</td><td>Rational numbers</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/ComplexStr">ComplexStr</a></td><td>&quot;137+0i&quot;</td><td>Complex numbers</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/xStr">Str</a></td><td>&quot;abc&quot;</td><td>Everything else</td></tr>


First, look at some values in the Perl 6 REPL. I use <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/val">val</a> on a bunch of strings and then call <code>WHAT</code> to see what <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/val">val</a> produced:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; val( &quot;137&quot; ).WHAT
(IntStr)
&gt; val( &quot;1e37&quot; ).WHAT
(NumStr)
&gt; val( &quot;1/137&quot; ).WHAT
(RatStr)
&gt; val( &quot;137+4i&quot; ).WHAT
(ComplexStr)
&gt; val( &quot;abc&quot; ).WHAT
(Str)
</pre>

Previously, the quote words didn&#39;t guess like this for us, but we can add the <code>:v</code> adverb (if you can find this in the docs, let me know so I can link to it):

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; qw:v{ 137 1.37e2 137+0i 1/137 }.perl
(IntStr.new(137, &quot;137&quot;), NumStr.new(137e0, &quot;1.37e2&quot;), ComplexStr.new(<137+0i>, &quot;137+0i&quot;), RatStr.new(<1 137></1>, &quot;1/137&quot;))
</137+0i></pre>

This is what the angle-bracket form of word quoting does (&quot;documented&quot; in <a href="https://design.perl6.org/S02.html#Allomorphic_value_semantics">S02: Allomorphic value semantics</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; <137 1 1.37e2 137 137+0i></137>.perl
(IntStr.new(137, &quot;137&quot;), NumStr.new(137e0, &quot;1.37e2&quot;), ComplexStr.new(<137+0i>, &quot;137+0i&quot;), RatStr.new(<1 137></1>, &quot;1/137&quot;))
</137+0i></pre>

The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/val">val</a> can tell you if Perl 6 thinks a string is a number and fail otherwise. Give it the <code>:val-or-fail</code> adverb and you might get an exception:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; val( &quot;123Camelia&quot;, :val-or-fail )
Cannot convert string to number: trailing characters after number in &#39;123⏏Camelia&#39; (indicated by ⏏)
</pre>

If you&#39;re expecting the lax string to number conversion of Perl 5, you&#39;re out of luck.

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &quot;123Camelia&quot; + 0
Cannot convert string to number: trailing characters after number in &#39;123⏏Camelia&#39; (indicated by ⏏)
</pre>

<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/val">val</a> returns the starting string when it can&#39;t convert it:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $s = val( &quot;123Camelia&quot; )
123Camelia
&gt; $s.WHAT
(Str)
</pre>

With <code>:val-or-fail</code>, you get a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Failure">Failure</a> object back instead:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $s = val( &quot;123Camelia&quot;, :val-or-fail )
Cannot convert string to number: trailing characters after number in &#39;123⏏Camelia&#39; (indicated by ⏏)
&gt; $s.WHAT
(Failure)
</pre>

<h3>Digit strings that aren&#39;t numbers</h3>

This means, though, that if you have strings that are digits but shouldn&#39;t be numbers (i.e. strings that use digits to identify a thingy but for whom there is no algebra), then angle brackets aren&#39;t what you want. You wouldn&#39;t want to put postal codes in them, for instance. Or vehicle number plates. Those might be digits, but you wouldn&#39;t add or multiply them. That is, you wouldn&#39;t want to pass them
through <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/val">val</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @zip_codes =   <02199 01614 02902 94039>; # not what you want
my @zip_codes = qw{ 02199 02902 01614 94039 }; # stays as strings
</02199></pre>

If you&#39;ve ever had to process postal code data that was incorrectly inserted, exported, or otherwise handled, you can appreciate this.

But, there are some times that you don&#39;t know if you need the number or string form. Perl 6 has signatures that can let it decide which subroutine or method to use in multiple dispatch.

Indeed, it&#39;s even difficult to justify putting most things into angle brackets because number things as strings already turn into the right thing with mathematical operators. You probably don&#39;t need Perl 6 to guess at these things for you ahead of time.

<h3>The case for lists of allomorphs</h3>

So what is the case for the angle brackets? You want to use them when
you want numbers to be either strings or numbers <i>types</i>. Some
things in Perl 6 can constrain the types of values they will accept. A subroutine signature might call for an <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Failure">Int</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub do_something ( Int $i ) { ... }
</pre>

But, perhaps you&#39;ve got a bunch of values of unknown origin or dubious parentage. The angle brackets leave strings as strings. It turns numbers and strings that look like numbers in allomorphs. The double angle brackets are for variable interpolation:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $a = &#39;123&#39;;
123
&gt; my $b = &#39;Butterfly&#39;
Butterfly
&gt; my $c = 321
321
&gt; &lt;<$a $b $c>&gt;.perl
(IntStr.new(123, &quot;123&quot;), &quot;Butterfly&quot;, IntStr.new(321, &quot;321&quot;))
</$a></pre>

Now, consider the case of constructing an argument list. You want the compactness that comes with the implied commas and quotes, but you need number-like strings:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub int-or-str ( Int $i, Str $s, Rat $r ) { say &quot;Hello&quot; }

int-or-str( 1, &#39;Butterfly&#39;, 1/2 );
int-or-str( |<1 1 2 butterfly></1> );
</pre>

In the first call, I make the argument list with commas and the types satisfy the signature for <code>int-or-str</code>. Everything works out.


If I use angle quotes (and turn the resulting List into an argument list (lowercase l) with the &quot;turn that List into an argument list&quot; operator (uppecase |)), it still works. The numberish things come out as <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/IntStr">IntStr</a> or <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/RatStr">RatStr</a>. Since <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/RatStr">RatStr</a> is both <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a> and <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str">Str</a> under multiple inheritance, a RatStr satifies either.

<h3>The stronger case for single things</h3>

The single thingy angle brackets is useful mostly for grouping when you don&#39;t a literal that may be constant folded (hence losing its type). Inside the angle brackets it&#39;s a number type:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; <1 137></1>.WHAT
(Rat)
</pre>

Wait a minute! That&#39;s not a stringy thing at all! But watch this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; <1 137></1>.WHAT
(RatStr)
</pre>

Okay, that&#39;s weird. With no spaces it&#39;s just the number type. With some whitespace, it&#39;s the allomorph type.

		<description><![CDATA[So far, my quick tips haven&#39;t been that quick. I&#39;ve gotten mired in the tarpit of tracking down weird behaviors and whatnot. Here&#39;s a truly quick tip. If you have more info on editor syntax highlighting for Perl 6, leave a comment. <!--more-->

If you&#39;re on StackOverflow and you want your code highlighted as Perl 6, use the HTML comment <code>&lt;!-- language-all: lang-perl6 --&gt;</code>. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/40814933/2766176">what Brad Gilbert did with one of my questions</a>. They use <a href="https://github.com/google/code-prettify">Google Prettify</a>, which does a job of the usual Google quality.

David Farrell explains how to activate Perl 6 syntax in his Perltricks article <a href="https://perltricks.com/article/194/2015/9/22/Activating-Perl-6-syntax-highlighting-in-Vim/">Activating Perl 6 syntax highlighting in Vim</a>. And, he&#39;s also supporting the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">Kickstarter campaign</a> by offering two more backers the chance to sponsor a Perl 6 article on Perltricks.

See the <a href="https://github.com/vim-perl/vim-perl">vim-perl</a> Github project, or the <a href="https://github.com/hinrik/perl6-mode">perl6-mode</a> Github project for emacs.

The Atom editor <a href="https://atom.io/packages/language-perl6fe">supports Perl 6</a>. It doesn&#39;t seem that helpful though.

The <a href="http://padre.perlide.org">Padre editor</a> does too. It even has a butterfly for its logo.

I started a <a href="/2016/01/10/a-perl-6-bbedit-codeless-language-module/">BBEdit Codeless Language Module</a>, but it&#39;s so deficient it&#39;s hardly worth mentioning.

One of Perl 6&#39;s goals for improvement over Perl 5 was a much easier way to parse the a program without being the language itself. There&#39;s an <a href="https://github.com/perl6/std">actual grammar</a>.

If you know of more stuff, leave a comment.]]></description>

		<title>Quick Tip #9: User-defined data types</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/11/24/quick-tip-8-user-defined-data-types/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 02:10:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has <a href="http://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/">&quot;gradual typing&quot;</a>. I can constrain values when I like, and let them run free otherwise. User-defined data types are one of the Perl 6 features that excite me the most. I can define what sort of value I can put in a container thingy, and I can define my own types any way that I like. <!--more-->

First, I&#39;ll show a couple of built-in types. I can constrain an array to contain only <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Int">Int</a> values. I place the type between the declarator and the variable name. If every value I want to store is that type, I have no problem. If there&#39;s a non-decimal integer string (say, a hex digit), I have a problem:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type &#39;exit&#39; or &#39;^D&#39;
&gt; my Int @array = <1 2 3>
[1 2 3]
&gt; my Int @other_array = <8 9 a b>
Type check failed in assignment to @other_array; expected Int but got Str (&quot;a&quot;)
</8></1></pre>

This means I can constrain some thing at the point I store them in the variable instead of checking a type-agnostic array every time I use it somewhere else.

Perl 6 already comes with some classes. The <code>Int</code> type is a platform-agnostic number that doesn&#39;t depend on the local ideas of integers. I could use the lowercase version, <code>int</code>, to specify a native type. Those are limited to the storage types on the platform:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my Int $j = 99999999999999999999
99999999999999999999
&gt; my int $j = 99999999999999999999
Cannot unbox 67 bit wide bigint into native integer
</pre>

I can make my own type. I can create my own classes and then use those class names as types:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; class Butterfly {}
(Butterfly)
&gt; my Butterfly $thingy1 = Butterfly.new
Butterfly.new
&gt; my $animal = Butterfly.new
Butterfly.new
&gt; $animal.WHAT
(Butterfly)
&gt; my Butterfly $thingy2 = $animal
Butterfly.new
&gt; my Butterfly $thingy3 = 137
Type check failed in assignment to $thingy3; expected Butterfly but got Int (137)
</pre>

Check that out! I didn&#39;t put anything in the class, but Perl 6 provided the <code>new</code> constructor for me. I&#39;ll write about that some other time.

I can create subtypes based on those that already exist. First, the
value has to satisfy the base type, then the extra constraint I put on it. I use subset to start it off and a where clause with some code:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; subset Vowel of Str where *.lc ∈ set( &lt;a e i o u y m&gt; )
(Vowel)
&gt; my Vowel $s = &#39;A&#39;;
A
&gt; my Vowel $s = &#39;e&#39;
e
&gt; my Vowel $s = &#39;j&#39;
Type check failed in assignment to $s; expected Vowel but got Str (&quot;j&quot;)
</pre>

In this case, I created a new type called <code>Vowel</code> based on <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str.html">Str</a>. The value has to be some sort of string, so thats a start, but I constrain it to be a string in a set (which I wrote about yesterday in <a href="/2016/11/23/quick-tip-8-perl-6-sets/">Perl 6 sets</a>).

Zoffix has a very good post, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2016/04/perl-6-types-made-for-humans.html">&quot;Perl 6 Types: Made for Humans&quot;</a> on the same thing, and Brad Clawsie created <a href="https://github.com/bradclawsie/Subsets-Common">Subsets::Common</a> to comprise interesting types. A  <a href="http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/222555/103630">StackExchange question on gradual typing</a> is very interesting as well, although it has virtually nothing to do with Perl 6. Jonathan
Worthington has an <a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-yapc-eu-perl6types.pdf">older presentation on types</a> from YAPC::EU 2008.]]></description>

		<title>Quick Tip #8: Perl 6 sets</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has proper sets and set-like types, along operators to do proper set operations. <!--more-->

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Set">Set</a> - a collection of unique thingys
</li><li><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Bag">Bag</a> - a collection of unique thingys, but weighted for the count of the number of times something is put the bag
</li><li><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Mix">Mix</a> - a bag that allows fractional weights
</li></ul>

These are immutable types. Once you make them, that&#39;s it. Each has a <code>*Hash</code> version that allows you to change the members, but I&#39;ll ignore those.

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; my $set = set( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
set(4, 3, 1, 2)
&gt; 4 ∈ $set                      # member of
True
&gt; 5 ∈ $set                      # member of
False
&gt; 5 ∉ $set                      # not member of
True
&gt; set( 2, 3 ) ⊆ $set            # subset of
True
&gt; set( 2, 6 ) ⊆ $set            # subset of
False
</pre>

A set is a more natural way to see if a value exists in a list of values. You might each for a hash and use <code>:exists</code> to check for the key, but a set will do that (even though that&#39;s what
Perl 6 sets are doing for you behind the scenes for now):

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $set  = set( &lt;a b c d&gt; );
my $item = &#39;h&#39;;
say &quot;$item is in set&quot; if $item ∈ $set;
</pre>


Perl 6 has the operators to turn two lists into a set:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) ∪ ( 4, 5 )        # union
set(5, 4, 3, 1, 2)
&gt; ( 1, 2, 4 ) ∩ ( 1,  2, 3 )    # intersection
set(1, 2)
&gt; ( 1, 2, 4 ) ∖ ( 1, 2, 3 )     # difference
set(4)
&gt; ( 1, 2, 4 ) ⊖ ( 1, 2, 3 )     # symmetric difference
set(4, 3)
</pre>

So far I&#39;ve used the fancy Unicode characters that you&#39;d see in set math, but each of these have <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_texas">Texas (ASCII) versions</a> too:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Texas</th>
<th>Fancy</th>
<th>Codepoint (hex)</th>
<th>Operation</th>

<tr><td>(elem)</td> <td>∈</td><td>U+2208</td><td>member of, <code>$a ∈ $set</code> or <code>$a (elem) $set</code></td></tr>

		<description><![CDATA[<i>[&quot;Texas&quot; as a cute name has been changed to the less offensive and more prosaic &quot;ASCII&quot;]</i>

Perl 6 is more than Unicode &quot;aware&quot;—it reaches into the Unicode Character Database to use appropriate and meaningful characters. There use to be a joke that the only thing that kept Perl 5 from expanding was the lack of unused punctuation keys. That&#39;s not a problem anymore. <!--more-->

But, for most Unicode thingys, there is an ASCII version. That version is probably multiple characters, so it&#39;s larger than the Unicode version. And, since it&#39;s a larger, super-sized version, we&#39;ll call it the &quot;Texas&quot; version. The Perl 6 docs <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_texas#Other_acceptable_single_codepoints">map the Unicode to ASCII versions</a>.

I wrote a small command-line program to convert between the two. It&#39;s not very sophisticated and I plan on improving it later. I&#39;d especially like to look up things based on what they do. For instance,  search for &quot;subset&quot; and get subset operators. Another data column with a description would be nice. And, reading all this from a file. Although I&#39;ve taken the data from a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_texas#Other_acceptable_single_codepoints">single page in the Perl 6 docs</a>, there are many other things I could add (such as the quoting stuff). I&#39;ve also saved this in my <a href="https://gist.github.com/briandfoy/619638701f38817387f3e5d22d6dab12">unicode2texas.p6 gist</a>.

Some notes on the program, which I didn&#39;t spend much time thinking about. In the <code>while</code> I put an <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Multi-line_/_embedded_comments">embedded comment</a> <code>#`(...)</code>. I think I want to create a data file to hold all of this. 

I use a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#Multi-dispatch">multi to define the same subroutine name several times but with different signatures</a>. Inside each, I specify that they take a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str">Str</a> but I constrain them with <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#Type_Constraints">where</a>. Those code blocks get the parameter as <code>$_</code> (or some other ways). That <code>$_</code> is the default &quot;topic&quot;,. When I neglect to type out the object in <code>.substr(0, 1)</code>, Perl 6 uses the topic. 

And, I do a few hash slices here, but never change the sigil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve often wished that Perl 5&#39;s <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/Data::Dumper">Data::Dumper</a> was built into the language. I often have statements like: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!perl5
Dumper( @array ); use Data::Dumper;
</pre>

Or, if I&#39;m playing with <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/Mojolicious">Mojolicious</a>:

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!perl5
use Mojo::Util qw(dumper);
dumper( @array );
</pre>

Rakudo (one of the Perl 6 implementations) has this baked in as <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/dd">dd</a>. This is something extra beyond the Perl 6 specification. Here I drop into the REPL:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; my @array = &#39;a&#39; .. &#39;g&#39;
[a b c d e f g]
&gt; dd @array
Array @array = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;]
</pre>

There is also the gist and perl methods. The first gives you output designed for people and the second shows the actual Perl interpretation:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; @array.gist
[a b c d e f g]
&gt; @array.perl
[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;]
</pre>

If that&#39;s not enough for you, there&#39;s the <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/">Data::Dump</a> module that can do many other things, including colorizing the output.

		<title>Quick Tip #5: The Z=> zip operator, lazy ranges, and terse hash creation.</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/11/20/the-z-zip-operator-lazy-ranges-and-terse-hash-creation/</link>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has some very sophisticated operators, and many of them naturally do the sorts of things that we do quite a bit unnaturally otherwise. The strength of these operators are the ugliness they hide from us. <!--more-->

Consider how I might turn a Perl 5 array into a hash, perhaps so I can use <code>exists</code> to lookup an item:

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!perl5
my @array = qw( a b c d );
my %hash  = map { $_ =&gt; 1 } @array;
</pre>

It might seem a bit shorter to try a hash slice assignment, but I like to declare my variables. This is this a bit goofy looking:

<pre>
#!perl5
my %hash;
@hash{ @array } = (1) x @array;
</pre>

It&#39;s a bit harder if I want the hash value to be the array position:

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!perl5
my @array = qw( a b c d );
my %hash  = map { $array[$_] =&gt; $_ } 0 .. $#array;

# ... or
@hash{ @array } = 0 .. $#array;
</pre>

I can still do these things the hard way in Perl 6. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Sequencer_Precedence">feed operators</a> (<code>==&gt;</code>, also known as <i>sequencer</i>) makes short work of declaring a variable on one side of the expression, doing work in the middle, and having the result end up in a declared variable on the other end. It&#39;s like an <code>xargs</code> for programming languages where the result of the generating side because the final arguments of the receiving side:

<pre class="brush:plain">
#!perl6
my @array = <a b c d>
	==&gt; map( { $_ =&gt; 1 } )
	==&gt; my %hash1;
</a></pre>

I know I&#39;m going to abuse those feed operators.

What if I want the array index to be the value. Or, is it? Perl 6 does quite a bit to make it easy to create lists. If you make it easy to create complex data structures, you&#39;re going to be a nice language.

I can use the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Zip_Operators">zip metaoperator</a>, <code>Z</code> to apply the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Item_Assignment_Precedence">item assignment operator</a>, <code>=&gt;</code> to corresponding pairs:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my %hash2 = @array Z=&gt; 0 .. @array.end;
</pre>

This takes the first item in <code>@array</code> and pairs it with the first item in the <code>0 .. @array.end</code>.

But, I don&#39;t even need to know about the end of the array. The zip operator stops when it gets to the end of the shorter list. I don&#39;t need to type out the name of the array again:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my %hash2 = @array Z=&gt; 0 .. *;
</pre>]]></description>

		<title>Quick Tip #4: The Hamming Sequence and hyper-operators</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/11/19/quick-tip-4-the-hamming-sequence-and-hyper-operators/</link>

		<description><![CDATA[The Hamming Sequence shows up in <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~cs410aph/Lectures/Smalltalk%20II/Dijkstra%20on%20Hamming&#39;s%20Problem.pdf">programming exercises</a>. It&#39;s the sequence of numbers that have only 2, 3, or 5 as divisors. The trick is to generate them in ascending order. Dijkstra figured it out, but he cheated a bit by restraining his problem to the first 1,000 values. Some people have a pre-occupation with programs that finish. <!--more-->

Dijkstra figured this out. Remember the elements in the list. Keep a set of indices to remember which elements in the list already have their multiples in the list. To get the next element in the sequence, try the next multiple for each factor. Take the least one and add it to the list. Increment the indices for the factors that produced a value less than or equal to the value just added. That&#39;s the next index to try for that factor.

In Perl 6 (or many other langauges), a direct translation of that might look like this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub get_sequence { my $seq := 1, { dijkstra() } ... *  }

sub MAIN ( $number = 30 ) {
	my $seq = get_sequence;

	say $seq[^$number];
	}

sub dijkstra {
	state @h = <1>;
	state ( $i, $j, $k ) = <0 0>;

	@h.push( min( 2*@h[$i], 3*@h[$j], 5*@h[$k] ) );

	$i++ if 2*@h[$i] &lt;= @h[*-1];
	$j++ if 3*@h[$j] &lt;= @h[*-1];
	$k++ if 5*@h[$k] &lt;= @h[*-1];

	return @h[*-1];
	}
</0></1></pre>

I wrote about lazy sequences in <a href="/2016/11/16/quick-tip-1-user-defined-infinite-sequences/">User-defined infinite sequences</a> and the <code>MAIN</code> in <a href="/2016/01/10/perl-6-modulinos-are-even-easier/">Perl 6 modulinos are even easier</a>. The <code>*-1</code> in the <code>@h</code> subscript gets me the last element. Perl 6 doesn&#39;t count backward, but a <code>*</code> (the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> thingy) in the subscript gets the number of elements in the array. From that I subtract 1 to get the last index.

But, I can do better. First, that example hard-coded the 2, 3, and 5. There are other &quot;smooth numbers&quot; that factor only into powers of small prime numbers.

So, I&#39;ll put the factors into their own array. Later I can convert that to a configurable parameter. I might want different factors, or a different number of factors.

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub dijkstra {
	state @h       = <1>;
	state @factors = <2 3 5>;
	state @indices = <0> xx @factors;

	@h.push( min( @h[ @indices ] &lt;<*>&gt; @factors ) );

	...;

	return @h;
	}
</*></0></2></1></pre>

So, I&#39;ll create an array of indices that has the same length of factors. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_xx">list replication</a>, <code>xx</code> does that for me. The array <code>@factors</code>, in numeric context, is the number of elements.

Then I use one of my favorite features of Perl, the hyper-operator. Let me break out that bit from the code:

<pre class="brush:plain">
@h[ @indices ] &lt;<*>&gt; @factors
</*></pre>

In the first example, I needed to multiply individual elements in <code>@h</code> with a list of factors (even though I hard-coded them). That&#39;s what the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Hyper_Operators">hyper-operators</a> do. It applies the operator between the angle brackets to corresponding elements of each list. In this case, it multiplies the first elements of each list, then the second, and so on. The grand result of is the list of results. I can put just about any operator in there that I like (and in a moment I&#39;ll do something fancy with that).

In this case, I&#39;ve used <code>@indices</code> to create an array slice of the elements in <code>@h</code> that still need a multiple. I hyper-multiply that with
<code>@factors</code>. It&#39;s the same thing as this line from the first example:

<pre class="brush:perl">
( 2*@h[$i], 3*@h[$j], 5*@h[$k] )
</pre>


But, this stuff won&#39;t work with the next bit because I got rid of the  <code>$i</code>, <code>$j</code>, and <code>$k</code> variables. Those values are now in the <code>@indices</code>. so I&#39;ve used the <code>...</code> <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#listop_...">stub operator</a> (or, the &quot;yada yada&quot;). That compiles, but Perl 6 dies when it executes it. I use it as a placeholder for work I still need to do.

Let&#39;s build up the next part. I need to increment the indices for the factors that produce sequence elements that are the same or less than the last value I stored in <code>@h</code>. In the first example I had three lines of code with repeated structure.

First, I need to figure out which indices I want to increment. Those are the ones where element in @h at that index is less than or equal to the last element in @h. Remember, some multiples will overlap when they have common factors. The number 10 is in the sequence because 5 is in the sequence and 5*2 is 10. But, it&#39;s also in the sequence because 2 is in the sequence and 2*5 is 10.

I can use the same code I just used to get the products:

<pre class="brush:perl">
( @h[ @indices ] &lt;<*>&gt; @factors )
</*></pre>

Now, I need to know which of those products are less than the last element of @h. I can use the hyper-operator again, but this time with
the <code>&lt;=</code> comparator:

<pre class="brush:perl">
( @h[ @indices ] «*» @factors ) «&lt;=» @h[*-1]
</pre>

But, I had to do something else here. When I put the <code>&lt;=</code> between the ASCII angle brackets, all sorts of parser confusion ensues. But, Perl 6 has a way around this by using fancy Unicode characters. The « and » characters do the same job, and since they aren&#39;t the ASCII version, the parser doesn&#39;t have a chance to confuse which angle brackets belong to what. Perl 6 calls the ASCII versions <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_texas">&quot;Texas-style&quot;</a>. For the non-Americans, Texas is a state in the U.S. that thinks they are the biggest. They&#39;re okay. They invented <a href="ninfas on navigator">fajitas</a>, Tex-Mex, and <a href="https://franklinbarbecue.com/menu/">Franklin BBQ</a>, so they can say that. The ASCII quotes are bigger, so <a href="http://code.activestate.com/lists/perl6-language/27015/">Larry calls them &quot;Texas&quot;</a>. You may know about &quot;Jersey barriers&quot; used to divide roads, but there are larger versions called &quot;Texas barriers&quot; as well as the largest version called Alaska Barriers. Don&#39;t tell Damian Conway or he might come up with even larger quoting mechanisms! But back to Perl 6.

The result of those two hyper-operators is a list of True and False values. The position of the Boolean value indicates whether I should increment the index in the same position. Now that I&#39;m that far, I can use a third hyper, this time with binary addition, to numerically add that list of Boolean values to <code>@indices</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
@indices «+=» ( ( @h[ @indices ] «*» @factors ) «&lt;=» @h[*-1] )
</pre>

Putting that together, I have something with no <code>if</code> statements:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub dijkstra () {
	state @h       = <1>;   # and so could this!
	state @factors = <2 3 5>; # this could be a parameter
	state @indices = <0> xx @factors;

	# add the next least multiple. This is the next number
	# in the sequence.
	@h.push( min( @h[ @indices ] «*» @factors ) );

	# Adjust the indices for the factor that were in the next number
	# more than one of these can be true!
	# For instance, 10 is both 5 * 2 and 2 * 5.
	@indices «+=» ( ( @h[ @indices ] «*» @factors ) «&lt;=» @h[*-1] );

	@h[*-1];
	}
</0></2></1></pre>

This generates the next value in the Hamming sequence. But, I&#39;m not done yet. The @h array holds the entire sequence even after I don&#39;t need some of the elements. I should get rid of those. Once all the indices are at least 1, I don&#39;t need the zeroth element anymore. I should get rid of it:

<pre class="brush:plain">
sub dijkstra () {
	state @h       = <1>;   # and so could this!
	state @factors = <2 3 5>; # this could be a parameter
	state @indices = <0> xx @factors;

	# add the next least multiple. This is the next number
	# in the sequence.
	@h.push( min( @h[ @indices ] «*» @factors ) );

	# Adjust the indices for the factor that were in the next number
	# more than one of these can be true!
	# For instance, 10 is both 5 * 2 and 2 * 5.
	@indices «+=» ( ( @h[ @indices ] «*» @factors ) «<=» # ) ); 1, 1. @factors @h[*-1] @h[0] @indices adjust all( already and any be don't element elements has if in index indices is least more multiples need number of remove sequence should the we> 0 {
		@h.shift;
		@indices&gt;&gt;--;
		}

	@h[*-1];
	}
</=»></0></2></1></pre>

In the last bit of code, I just the <code>all</code> <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction">Junction</a> to check  that every index is greater than 0. If so, I take the first element off <code>@h</code>. But, when I do that, I need to adjust all of the indices down one. The hyper-operators work for unary operators (such as the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#postfix_--">auto-decrement</a> <code>--</code>). This time there&#39;s one set of quotey things, with the alligator mouth toward the list thingy.

		<description><![CDATA[Every day of the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">Learning Perl 6 Kickstarter campaign</a>, I&#39;ll present a quick tip about something I like in Perl 6. Yesterday I posted <a href="/2016/11/17/quick-tip-2-fancier-sequences/">Fancier sequences</a>. In that post I only showed how you could use blocks to decide the next element in the sequence. <!--more-->

There&#39;s some other interesting syntax that sequences and ranges (and a few other things). You already know how to make the fancy sequences, so I won&#39;t distract you with that in this post. I&#39;ll use simple, boring sequences for this post.

By default, the <code>..</code> (<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Range.html">Range</a>) and <code>...</code> (<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Seq.html">Sequence</a>) operators include their end points. The range <code>0..9</code> includes the 0 and the 9. That&#39;s mostly what you want and mostly what you expect.

Rather than writing programs, let&#39;s look at these in the Perl 6 REPL. When you start <i>perl6</i> without arguments, you drop into the <i>perl6</i> shell:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type &#39;exit&#39; or &#39;^D&#39;
&gt; 0 .. 9
0..9
</pre>

The REPL shows the result of what I entered. In this case, it shows me the sequence although it has not evaluated it yet.

The list or flat methods will turn it into, well, a list. I can also assign it to a listy thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (0..9).list
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
&gt; (0..9).flat
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
&gt; my @a = 0 .. 9;
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
</pre>

You should have line history already (if not, <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq.html#How_can_I_get_command_line_history_in_the_Perl_6_prompt_(REPL)?">See the FAQ</a>), so you can arrow up to change the previous command without re-typing everything.

I try it again by including a <code>^</code> before the end element. This makes the end <i>exclusive</i>. It excludes the element from the list:

<pre class="brush:plain">
(0..^9).flat
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8) 
</pre>

I can do the same on the other side to exclude the starting element:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (0^..9).flat
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
</pre>

Or I can do it on both sides:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (0^..^9).flat
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
</pre>

I can put spaces around the start or end elements:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (0 ^..^ 9).flat
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
</pre>

But not between the <code>^</code> and the <code>..</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (0 ^.. ^9).flat
Range objects are not valid endpoints for Ranges
</pre>

The operators are actually <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_..">..</a></code>, <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_^..">^..</a></code>, <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_..^">..^</a></code>, or <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_^..^">^..^</a></code>.

I can use this to terminate the sequences as well. I already showed the infinite sequence. But, I can use a condition as the end point. When the condition is true, the sequence ends. In this case, it&#39;s just a numerical comparison:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1 ... * &gt; 15 ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16)
</pre>

And, if I don&#39;t want to element that ends the sequence, I exclude it:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1 ...^ * &gt; 15 ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)
</pre>

I can have a block at the end, and I can exclude the value that makes the block true:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1 ... -&gt; $a { $a &gt; 15 } ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16)
&gt; ( 1 ...^ -&gt; $a { $a &gt; 15 } ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)
</pre>

But, the block can be anything that I like. I can terminate the sequence after a certain time passes:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1 ... -&gt; $a { state $t = now; now &gt; $t + 0.01 } ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16)
&gt; ( 1 ... -&gt; $a { state $t = now; now &gt; $t + 0.02 } ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18)
&gt; ( 1 ... -&gt; $a { state $t = now; now &gt; $t + 0.06 } ).list
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 ...)

		<title>Quick Tip #2: Fancier sequences</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Every day of the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">Learning Perl 6 Kickstarter campaign</a>, I&#39;ll present a <a href="/category/kickstarter-tips/">quick tip</a> about something I like in Perl 6. Yesterday I posted <a href="/2016/11/16/quick-tip-1-user-defined-infinite-sequences/">User-defined infinite sequences</a>. In that post I only showed sequences of positive numbers. That&#39;s a bit boring. Let&#39;s make something fancier. <!--more-->

Let&#39;s start with one of the boring examples that every programming language likes to use. It&#39;s a bit not-safe-for-work. About 800 years ago, Fibonacci spent a lot of time thinking about what adult rabbits do with their free time. He didn&#39;t invent the problem, but he gets all the credit:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $fibonacci := 1, 1, { $^a + $^b } ... *;
say &quot;Fibonacci: &quot; ~ $fibonacci[0..10];
</pre>

Here&#39;s the result:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Fibonacci: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
</pre>

We can create an infinite, lazy sequence. (As a side not, doesn&#39;t that sound wrong? The order of adjectives in English is customarily quantity followed by opinion. Doesn&#39;t lazy, infinite lists sound better?)

But, what&#39;s going on with that sequence? I start off with two literals, the <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>. But, after that I have a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#Blocks_and_Lambdas">block</a>. When Perl 6 sees a block in the sequence, it uses it to compute the next element. And, I can do anything I like in that block.

But, what&#39;s going in the block? There&#39;s a <code>$^a</code> and a <code>$^b</code>. Perl 6 figures out that this block takes two arguments and grabs the previous two items from the sequence to fill those variables. The last evaluated expression in the block becomes the next value in the sequence. After that it starts all over. And, since I used the Whatever <code>*</code> at the end, the sequence goes on forever.

The Lucas Sequence is similar:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $lucas := 2, 1, 3, { $^a + $^b } ... *;
say &quot;Lucas: &quot; ~ $lucas[0..10];
</pre>

Here&#39;s the result:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Lucas: 2 1 3 4 7 11 18 29 47 76 123
</pre>

Let&#39;s do something more interesting. There&#39;s a sequence of &quot;digit product&quot;. You take the number and split it up into individual decimal digits. Multiply all of those and add that product to the original number. That&#39;s the next number in the sequence. Here it is:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $d := 1, { $^a + [*] $^a.comb } ... *;
say &quot;Digit product: &quot; ~ $d[0..10];
</pre>

Here&#39;s the result:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Digit product: 1 2 4 8 16 22 26 38 62 74 102
</pre>

There are a few interesting things in that block. First, I call the <code>comb</code> method to break the number up into digits. In front of that is the <code>[*]</code> <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Reduction_Operators">reduction operator</a>. It takes two elements from the succeeding list, performs the operation inside the square braces, and puts the result back on the list. It does this until there&#39;s a single element left. That gives me the product of the digits.

Once I have the product, I add it to the original number (still in <code>$^a</code>). Now I have the next item in the sequence.

Not fancy enough? How abou the &quot;speak and say&quot; sequence? Take a number, such as 1. Now, say the count of the like digits and the digit word. So, there is &quot;one 1&quot;. Translate that into digits, so <code>11</code>. Do it again. There&#39;s &quot;two 1s&quot;, or <code>21</code>, then, &quot;one 2 and one 1&quot;, so <code>1211</code>. Keep doing that until you get bored with it:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $speak_and_say := 1, { .subst( /(<[0..9]>)$0*/, { .chars() ~ .[0] }, :g ) } ... *;
say &quot;Speak and say: &quot; ~ $speak_and_say[0..5];
</[0..9]></pre>

The result is:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Speak and say: 1 11 21 1211 111221 312211
</pre>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every day of the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">Learning Perl 6 Kickstarter campaign</a>, I&#39;ll present a <a href="/category/kickstarter-tips/">quick tip</a> about something I like in Perl 6. Let&#39;s start with sequences. <!--more-->

We have simple sequences, like one digit to another. Here&#39;s 0 to 9:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $tenner := 0 ... 9;
</pre>

Notice a few things here. I&#39;ve used the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_:=">infix binding operator, <code>:=</code></a>. It doesn&#39;t assign a value, it makes the lefthand side the same as the righthand side.

The <code>...</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_...">sequence operator</a>, which we can use to produce <i>lazy</i> lists.

Lazy lists, you say? What if I wanted not just 0 to 9, but 0 to whatever number I felt like for as long as I wanted to run the program. I don&#39;t know what that number might be, so I won&#39;t specify it. I&#39;ll just call it &quot;whatever&quot; with the <code>*</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $infinite := 0 ... *;
</pre>

Perl 6 doesn&#39;t compute this sequence. It knows that it starts at zero and keeps going until it reaches the end. That <code>*</code> is literally a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> object. When Perl 6 wants to know if it&#39;s at the end, <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> says no.

That could be a long, long list. But, the laziness takes care of that. Perl 6 doesn&#39;t evaluate the next item until it needs it. This loop will go on forever:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for $infinite -&gt; $next {
	say $next;
	}
</pre>

Big deal. We&#39;ve had infinite loops forever (does anyone know who made the first one?). We can do this with <code>loop</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
loop ( my $i = 0; ; $i++ ) {
	say $i;
	}
</pre>

But, a loop is just a loop. It sits there all by itself. However, we can pass around a sequence, we can store it. We can so many other things with it. We can put it in a hash and choose the one we need later:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my %hash;

%hash&lt;s&gt; := 7 ... 10;
%hash&lt;t&gt; := 0 ...  3;
%hash&lt;u&gt; := 137 ...  *;

show( %hash{ time %% 2 ?? &#39;t&#39; !! &#39;s&#39; } );

sub show ( $s ) {
	.say for |$s;
	}
</pre>

Yep, we just stored an infinite number of values in a single hash value. I&#39;ll have more on this in the next entry.]]></description>

		<title>Experiment in the Perl 6 REPL</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/10/15/experiment-in-the-perl-6-repl/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 09:58:00 -0500</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[brian]]></dc:creator>
		
		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has a REPL. That&#39;s a tiny, language-specific shell that <b>R</b>eads a line, <b>E</b>valuates it, <b>P</b>rints the result, and <b>L</b>oops to do it again. It can remember the previous results in the same session.

Let&#39;s start with something simple. Run the <i>perl6</i> command with no arguments and wait for the prompt: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type &#39;exit&#39; or &#39;^D&#39;
&gt;
</pre>

I can try the usual &quot;Hello World&quot; program:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;
Hello World!
</pre>

I can try it with <code>say</code>, which outputs the string with a newline on the end. That&#39;s how I would need to output it inside a program; inside the REPL, that doesn&#39;t look different than
what I already did:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; say &#39;Hello World!&#39;
Hello World!
</pre>

In Perl 6 land, a string is an object, so I can call methods on the string. Perl 6 uses the dot as the method call operator:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.say
Hello World!
</pre>

What else can I do with &lt;code&#39;&quot;Hello World!&#39;? Perl 6 values are themselves objects. The <code>WHAT</code> &quot;meta&quot; method knows what thingys are:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.WHAT
(Str)
</pre>

The <code>(Str)</code> is the name of the class in parentheses. I don&#39;t need to know the type of thing it is to figure out what I can do. Or, read another way, I don&#39;t need to look at the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str">docs for Str</a> to see what methods I can call. The <code>.^methods</code> method (ahem) tells me what the object can respond to:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods
(BUILD Int Num chomp pred succ simplematch match ords samecase
samemark samespace word-by-word trim-leading trim-trailing trim
encode NFC NFD NFKC NFKD wordcase trans indent codes chars uc lc tc
fc tclc flip ord WHY WHICH Bool Str Stringy DUMP ACCEPTS chop
starts-with ends-with substr-eq contains indices index rindex Numeric
gist perl comb subst-mutate subst lines split words)
</pre>

That <code>.^methods</code> looks weird, but it&#39;s really just a shortcut for <code>.HOW.methods</code>. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Metamodel$COLON$COLONClassHOW"><b>H</b>igher <b>O</b>rder <b>W</b>orkings</a> class has many ways to <i>introspect</i> a thingy. This is an amazing boon to learning the language since you can, at least partly, discover things about the objects from inside the language. All your Ruby friends will say &quot;Welcome to 1995!&quot;.

Notice that <code>say</code> is not in the list. By default, <code>.^methods</code> doesn&#39;t show methods from certain base classes. I can ask for different slices of that list by adding the <code>:all</code> adverb:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all)
(BUILD Int Num chomp pred succ simplematch match ords samecase
samemark samespace word-by-word trim-leading trim-trailing trim encode
NFC NFD NFKC NFKD wordcase trans indent codes chars uc lc tc fc tclc
flip ord WHY WHICH Bool Str Stringy DUMP ACCEPTS chop starts-with
ends-with substr-eq contains indices index rindex Numeric gist perl
comb subst-mutate subst lines split words trans fmt comb acosech cotan
sin fc contains EVAL cosec atan2 abs ord trim-trailing ords acotan
asec ceiling unpolar acosec acos indices log10 exp match subst chrs
acosh truncate acotanh Num path floor UInt words flip asin codes
univals asech chomp split cotanh ...)
</pre>

That&#39;s right, I said adverb. Things that start with a colon are modifiers for an action. You can worry about those later. In this case, <code>:all</code> modifies how <code>.^methods</code> responds.

Still, I don&#39;t see <code>say</code> in that list, which is truncated with <code>...</code>. Perl 6 displays the result as a &quot;gist&quot;, or, the general idea of the result in a human-readable form. It&#39;s the same thing as this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all).gist
</pre>

This gist an amazing feature. I&#39;ve wished that <a href="">Data::Dumper</a> was built into Perl 5 so many times. Now it&#39;s available to most objects automatically, but it is not going to overload you with output. I&#39;ll have to do a bit of work on my own for that.

If that&#39;s too high-level for you, the <code>perl</code> method is closer to the internal representation. You can run this yourself if you&#39;d like to see the very long and complicated output that&#39;s pretty useless to all but 11 people in the world:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all).perl
</pre>

But, I want to find that <code>say</code> method. What do I get back from <code>^methods()</code>? I call <code>WHAT</code> again and see that I get a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/List">List</a> object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all).WHAT
(List)
</pre>

That&#39;s a list, but what&#39;s in the list? I can call <code>map</code> on the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/List">List</a>. I cheat a bit here because I know that there should be something like <code>map</code> and I looked at the documentation. I&#39;d much rather discover that through exploration, but that&#39;s how it is at the moment:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all).map( {.WHAT.gist} ).unique
((Submethod) (Method) (Method+{Callable[Int:D]}) (Method+{&lt;anon|140546676469920&gt;}))
</pre>


The <code>map</code> gets each item in the list and passes it to the block argument. Perl 6 does some impressive stuff with blocks, but for now think of it as an inline subroutine. Inside this <code>map</code>, I call <code>.WHAT.gist</code>. What&#39;s up with the leading dot?

Perl 6 has a default variable, which it calls the <i>topic</i>. If there&#39;s no object in front of the method-calling dot, it uses that topic.

Once I&#39;ve constructed that list I call <code>unique</code> to make a list of just the types it saw. Each thing is a some sort of <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Method">Method</a>.

A <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Method">Method</a> knows its name (if it has one). This in itself is quite interesting. If I call <code>can</code> on an object and that object can respond to a method of that name, it gives me back a list of methods? (A list? Yep! Because Perl 6 has multi dispatch based on the arguments I pass!). Even though I have a list of one item, I only want to first item. I store that in <code>$method</code> (which I must declare before use):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $method = &#39;Hello World!&#39;.can( &#39;say&#39; ).first
say
</pre>


The REPL remembers what I stored in that variable. It&#39;s a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Method">Method</a> and I can ask it its name. I can also use the variable in place of the literal method name to operate on my string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; $method.name
say
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.$method
Hello World!
</pre>

It&#39;s a bit easier to see if I use a different method, such as <code>uc</code> to uppercase

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $method = &#39;Hello World!&#39;.can( &#39;uc&#39; ).first
uc
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.$method
HELLO WORLD!
</pre>

This is very exciting! It might not seem like much, but when these things are objects that know things about themselves, a big world of  programming opens up.

But, I started off looking for <code>say</code> but I haven&#39;t found it yet.

I can make a new list of just the names by calling <code>map</code> and <code>sort</code> that. When I give only one argument to the block in <code>sort</code>, it uses that result to compare elements. It also remembers that value so it does not calculate it again (so, no Schwartzian Transform needed!):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all).map( { .name } ).sort( { .lc } ).unique.join( &quot;\n&quot; )
</pre>

This creates a really long string, but it&#39;s all the methods available on <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code>. I can make a shorter list with <code>grep</code> by looking for things that have <code>sa</code> at the start of the string:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; &#39;Hello World!&#39;.^methods(:all).map( {.name} ).grep( { /^^ sa/ } ).join( &quot;\n&quot; )
samecase
samemark
samespace
samecase
say
</pre>

And, I&#39;ve found <code>say</code>! It took me a bit, but I was able to find out quite a bit starting with just the object.

I can define my own class with some attributes. Here&#39;s a <code>Butterfly</code> class that has a name and a type attribute. I
can create an object in that class, then look at the

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; class Butterfly { has Str $.name; has Str $.type; }
(Butterfly)
&gt; my $camelia = Butterfly.new( name =&gt; &#39;Camelia&#39;, type =&gt; &#39;Monarch&#39; );
Butterfly.new(name =&gt; &quot;Camelia&quot;, type =&gt; &quot;Monarch&quot;)
&gt; $camelia.WHAT
(Butterfly)
&gt; $camelia.^attributes
(Str $!name Str $!type)
</pre>

I could keep going like this to try bits of Perl 6. I don&#39;t have to write programs for the very short experiements. Personally, I like to keep the experiments in files because I keep changing things. It&#39;s better than retyping.]]></description>

There&#39;s nothing particularly fancy here and I tried to keep it close to the version I wrote in Perl 5 and <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20071217-00/?p=24143">the way Raymond Chen presented it</a>. <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">

Match 8.3 filenames in the DOS way, from Raymond Chen

https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20071217-00/?p=24143

1. Start with eleven spaces and the cursor at position 1.

2. Read a character from the input. If the end of the input is
reached, then stop.

3. If the next character in the input is a dot, then set positions 9,
10, and 11 to spaces, move the cursor to position 9, and go back to
step 2.

4. If the next character in the input is an asterisk, then fill the
rest of the pattern with question marks, move the cursor to position
12, and go back to step 2. (Yes, this is past the end of the pattern.)

5. If the cursor is not at position 12, copy the input character to
the cursor position and advance the cursor.

*: Remember that Perl 6 counts strings counting from zero.

=end pod

for $=finish.lines -&gt; $line {
	my $dos_pattern = &#39; &#39; x 11;
	my $cursor = 0;

2:      A*B.TXT -&gt;  A???????TXT
3:          *.* -&gt;  ???????????
4:            * -&gt;  ???????????
5:        *.TXT -&gt;  ????????TXT
6:         .TXT -&gt;          TXT
</pre>

But let&#39;s look at some differences.

I have <code>$line.split(&quot;&quot;, :skip-empty)</code>. Splitting with an empty string creates empty elements at the beginning <i>and</i> end of the list, so I can add the <code>:skip-empty</code>. 

There&#39;s a <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Str#routine_chars"><code>chars</code></a> method in the <code>Str</code> class, but it doesn&#39;t return characters. It returns a count. The <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Str#routine_lines"><code>lines</code></a> method, however, returns lines and not a count.

The <a href="https://doc.perl6.org/type/Str"><code>Str</code> class</a> has several <code>subst*</code> methods that do slightly different things. The <code>subset-rw</code> provides the lvalue that I can assign to. 

And, check out that anonymous variable in the <code>printf</code> line. Perl 6 has a feature that creates persistent state variables that are private to a statement. Don&#39;t give the variable a name. <code>$++</code> is a variable without a name that I post-increment. That&#39;s pretty handy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the early days of Perl 6 we don&#39;t have a library of reliable books, mostly because the language had shifted so rapidly. But, there are plenty of examples of Perl 6. I&#39;ve listed some of them in the sidebar of <a href="/">this website</a>. <!--more-->

<ul>
<li>The <a href="//github.com/perl6/roast">test suite (&quot;roast&quot;)</a> for Perl 6 has examples of almost all of the features so developers can verify the specification.
</li><li><a href="//rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Perl_6">Rosetta Code has a section with Perl 6 examples</a>.
</li><li><a href="//examples.perl6.org/">There&#39;s examples.perl6.org</a>, which includes <a href="//examples.perl6.org/categories/euler.html">Project Euler solutions</a>. See it&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples">GitHub repo</a> too.
</li><li><a href="//learnxinyminutes.com/docs/perl6/">Learn Perl 6 in Y minutes</a> is a summary of Perl 6, in code.
</li></ul>

We don&#39;t emphasize code reading enough. We&#39;re used to teaching you how to write new code, usually while you struggle with a particular concept we give you. You&#39;ll learn much more by reading code. Someone else will do it slightly differently or even in a completely different way using features you didn&#39;t know about.]]></description>

		<title>Don't install over your existing Perl 6</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/02/06/dont-install-over-your-existing-perl-6/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2016 20:27:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[When you want to install a new Perl 6 (or any of its backend stuff), don&#39;t install over what you already have working. The language and the tools aren&#39;t stable or reliable enough for you to end up with something that still works. It&#39;s getting better (relative to Pugs, which could take days, or the situation five years ago), but it doesn&#39;t pass the <a href="//www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Grandma+Test">grandma test</a> yet. <!--more-->

I&#39;m at the first meeting of the Perl 6 Study Group in NYC, which Jim Keenan has organized in the back of <a href="//www.yelp.com/biz/d-b-a-new-york-2">dba</a>. That&#39;s the same place the first ever Perl users group meeting took place. My goal today was to explore some installation strategies for Perl 6.

First, you aren&#39;t merely installing Perl 6. There&#39;s a <b>backend</b> you&#39;ll need. Perl 6 can run on <a href="//www.moarvm.org">MoarVM</a>, JVM, and maybe a few others. You&#39;ll need to build that. Second, you need to bootstrap Perl 6 since it&#39;s written in Perl 6. <a href="//github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP</a> (Not Quite Perl 6) is the path to that bootstrapping. Third, there&#39;s the Perl 6 implementation. Most people will go for <a href="//rakudo.org/downloads/star/">Rakudo</a>, but one of the goals of Perl 6 is to get away from the single, canonical interpreter we have in Perl 5 Land.

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="392" src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/574/moar-cat.jpg" width="500">
</div>
</div>

Most of this you won&#39;t have to worry about in most cases. The <a href="//github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew">rakudobrew</a> tool automates this. When you follow that link, you&#39;ll end up on a GitHub page. When you run rakudobrew, you&#39;ll pull from several GitHub projects:

<pre class="brush:perl">
my %git_repos = (
    rakudo =&gt; &quot;$GIT_PROTO://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git&quot;,
    MoarVM =&gt; &quot;$GIT_PROTO://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM.git&quot;,
    nqp    =&gt; &quot;$GIT_PROTO://github.com/perl6/nqp.git&quot;,
    panda  =&gt; &quot;$GIT_PROTO://github.com/tadzik/panda.git&quot;,
    zef    =&gt; &quot;$GIT_PROTO://github.com/ugexe/zef.git&quot;,
);
</pre>

I strongly believe that the path to mastery includes understanding what a tool does even if it automates really annoying stuff that you don&#39;t want to think about. You see the rakudo, MoarVM, and NQP components there. Panda and zef are Perl 6 module tools.

Pulling directly from repos, even if its from a  specific tag, seems fragile and makes me nervous. Some of this is technically unfounded but socially aware. Pulling from several repos each time I want to build Perl 6 also makes me nervous. I could download <a href="//rakudo.org/downloads/star/">Rakudo Star</a>, a tarball that includes the basics and a MoarVM and install it by hand.

rakudobrew is more interesting because it should manage several installed versions at the same time. Pulling from the repositories works fine, but the various hand-offs to external programs and the shell are fragile. I talked to a tech from Amazon Web Services about setting up a shared Perl 6 machine, and sadly he ran into problems on a fresh install of everything. These aren&#39;t uncommon. It&#39;s also the first problem that people are going to run into and the quickest way that they are going to give up. We need more binary packages until the installation system is reliable to the point that we never think about it.

For my task, I installed several by hand and these worked without a problem:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl Configure.pl --prefix=/Users/brian/Dropbox/Perl6/20160205 --gen-moar --make-install
$ perl Configure.pl --prefix=/Users/brian/Dropbox/Perl6/20160205.2 --gen-moar --make-install
$ git checkout -b v6.c
$ perl Configure.pl --prefix=/Users/brian/Dropbox/Perl6/6.c --gen-moar --make-install
</pre>

For some reason, the same session wouldn&#39;t build using rakudobrew. It would fail with the a similar mismatch in tools I reported in <a href="//github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/334">Issue 334 for MoarVM</a>. Basically, the installer chooses a set of tools and adds them to the Makefile as the command name, like  <code>AR=ar</code>. This leaves it up to the path to choose the first one it finds, not the one that goes with the compiler it chose.

I recommend that you don&#39;t nuke your existing implementation when you want a different version of Perl 6. You might even up with something that doesn&#39;t work. I should be old enough to know not to install new software while I&#39;m at an airport, but I tried to upgrade and spent the rest of the flight trying to fix the installation errors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Topaz, which was almost the next version of Perl in 2000, is still in Sourceforge. Chip Salzenberg had a hunch that rewriting Perl&#39;s guts in C++ would be the thing to solve its maintenance issues. He codenamed his project <a href="http://topaz.sourceforge.net">Topaz</a> and went to work. <!--more-->

He didn&#39;t get it working though, and Chip&#39;s the sort of guy that can get anything working. He took C++ to its limits. At the 1999 OSCON, he explained what he wanted to do and why he chose C++ in his talk <a href="//www.perl.com/pub/1999/09/topaz.html">Topaz: Perl for the 22nd Century</a>. It&#39;s old enough that there&#39;s a RealAudio version of the talk. Heck, the Topaz repo uses CVS. I tried compiling CVS but it doesn&#39;t like my <code>getline</code> (and I didn&#39;t try that hard).

</div>
</div>

A year later he had given up, for solid technical reasons, but also because the community pushed all in for Perl 6.  I recall a talk where Chip discussed very technical C++ things he discovered, but it seems to have disappeared from the world. We also might have been sitting around a table in the hallway listening to him talk about it too. For what it&#39;s worth, Simon Cozens tried a similar thing with <a href="//www.perl.com/pub/2000/09/sapphire.html">Sapphire</a> (and there&#39;s <a href="http://perl11.org">Perl 11</a> and <a href="http://rperl.org">RPerl</a> and ...).

Much of the discussion around that time was about which language the next perl sources would use. The then current Perl 5 sources were in C and had macros on top of macros (on top of macros) as it bent over backward to not conflict with other C code it might be embedded next to. Today we have <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/DBI">DBI</a> as a generic database interface, but back in the day there were things like <b>oraperl</b>, an Oracle client with Perl embedded in it (or Perl with an Oracle client embedded in it).

Other options were briefly considered, but a crazy idea stuck. Perl 6 would be written in Perl 6. That sounds a little weird, but if you unwind it a bit it works. 

There&#39;s <a href="//github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP</a>, or &quot;Not Quite Perl 6&quot; which serves as a basic layer between a virtual machine and Perl 6. From that, NQP looks quite a bit like Perl 6 and can bootstrap Perl 6. As long as NQP can translate its part to the layer under it, Perl 6 can go anywhere NQP can go. That might be Parrot, a JVM, or <a href="//www.moarvm.org">MOAR</a> (MetaModel on a Runtime).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now I have rudimentary Perl 6 syntax coloring for BBEdit, my long-preferred editor on the Mac for years. I don&#39;t need anything fancy, so I did the minimum to color the stuff in the files I had open. BBEdit supports <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html">Codeless Language Modules</a> that specify various things about the language, including its file extensions, name, keywords, and so on. It&#39;s something a normal user can put into an XML or JSON file and drop into an <i>Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules</i> directory for immediate use (with an application restart). It&#39;s not as clever as a compiled code module, but good enough for me at the moment. <!--more-->

		<title>Perl 6 modulinos are even easier</title>
		<link>http://www.learningraku.com/2016/01/10/perl-6-modulinos-are-even-easier/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2016 12:48:00 -0500</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[Perl 6 has this wonderful thing called <code>MAIN</code> which is a built-in modulino thingy.

In my <a href="http://www.excellentnums.com">excellent number hobby</a> (which I started <a href="http://www.masteringperl.org/tag/excellent-numbers/">writing about in Mastering Perl</a> even after I switched to C), I&#39;ve been converting some bits to Perl 6 just for giggles. There&#39;s a small <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/excellent_numbers/blob/master/lib/CpuCount.pm">Perl 5 module I wrote to get the number of CPUs</a> I rewrote in Perl 6. It&#39;s not sophisticated or surprising. It&#39;s actually quite banal in function; merely dispatch to some method that knows what to do on the platforms I care about. And, be a modulino. <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
module CpuCount {
	sub run () is export {
		say get_cpu_count();
		}

	sub get_cpu_count () is export {
		state $dispatch = {
			freebsd  =&gt; &amp;_freebsd,
			_default =&gt; &amp;_posix,
			};

		my $key = $dispatch.{ $*DISTRO.name }:exists ?? $*DISTRO.name !! &#39;_default&#39;;

		$dispatch.{ $key }.();
		}

	sub _freebsd () { _get_conf( &#39;NPROCESSORS_ONLN&#39; ) }

	sub _posix ()   { _get_conf( &#39;_NPROCESSORS_ONLN&#39; ) }

	sub _get_conf ( $key ) {
		state $command = &#39;/usr/bin/getconf&#39;;

		unless $key ~~ m/ ^^ <[_a..z0..9]>+ $$ / {
			warn &quot;Key $key doesn&#39;t look acceptable&quot;;
			return;
			};
		qq:x{$command $key 2&gt;/dev/null}.chomp;
		}
	}

sub MAIN {
	import CpuCount;
	run;
	}
</[_a..z0..9]></pre>

First, <code>MAIN</code>. Perl 6 calls that if the file is the top-level thingy rather than something that&#39;s loaded by something else. No more <code>caller</code> tricks. It&#39;s even better though. Although I don&#39;t need it here, if I give <code>MAIN</code> a signature, it does some argument handling automatically. And, lexical imports!

Back to the top of the program, I can create a <code>module</code>, similar to Perl 5&#39;s <code>package BLOCK</code> syntax. I really like that. I get export handling without inheritance (that I can see, at least) by marking what is eligible with <code>is export</code>.

Inside <code>get_cpu_count</code>, I use the <code>$*DISTRO</code> special variable to find out what system I&#39;m on. That&#39;s an object with various parts I can access.

In the dispatch table, I get a reference to a subroutine by using the <code>&amp;</code> in front of it. That messed me up for a bit, but I think I like that.

In <code>_get_conf</code>, I have a regex. That&#39;s changed quite a bit with double typing. The <code>^^</code> and <code>$$</code> are anchors, whitespace is insignificant by default, and character classes are much fancier. Those are put in <code> &lt;[ ... ]&gt; </code> because you can do set operations on the things in the square brackets. Very fancy, but there&#39;s more typing. I also have to use <code>..</code> to make a range of characters. Disk drives are cheap, so let&#39;s use up those bytes!

I love string objects. I call the external command and can <code>chomp</code> it right away. And, <code>chomp</code> returns the modified string like God always wanted.]]></description>

Andrew Shitov&#39;s <i><a href="http://deeptext.media/perl6-at-a-glance/">Perl 6 at a Glance</a></i> is already shipping out books. I haven&#39;t had a chance to read it myself, but from the excerpts on the website this looks like a nice survey of the Perl 6 language. It&#39;s not a tutorial book like <i>Learning Perl 6</i>, but I think it&#39;s more than enough to whet your appetite for some of the cool features.

If you are daunted by the reams of pages the printed docs would be, this 130-page book may give you what you need to know with a lot less work.]]></description>
