		<div class="excerpt">





Perl 6 has a wealth of comparison operators so I don&#39;t have to do a lot of work to test complex data structures. Consider the case where I want to test two lists. I might reach for the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_eq"><code>eq</code></a> and think that it works. Here&#39;s a demonstration of that in the REPL: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) eq ( 1, 2, 4 )
False
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) eq ( 1, 2, 3 )
True
</pre>

That looks like it works. The list that has different elements returns <code>False</code> and the one that looks like it has the same elements returns <code>True</code>. But, this is a quirk of my choice of test cases. Had I read the docs (and, admit it, many of us only do that when something expected happens), I would have known that <code>eq</code> coerces its arguments to strings and compares those. It is, after all, a string comparison operator (although in a multi-dispatch language you (and I) might guess such operators would multi-dispatch).

Using <code>eq</code> breaks if lists with different values stringify the same way, like these. Since the string coercion joins the elements with a space, spaces at the start or end of elements make it impossible to distinguish the separator from the values:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, &#39;2 &#39;, 3 ) eq ( 1, 2, &#39; 3&#39; )
True
</pre>

That&#39;s no good. But, this is why Perl 6 has more comparison operators. The <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_eq"><code>eqv</code></a> tests that two things have the same values:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, &#39;2 &#39;, 3 ) eqv ( 1, 2, &#39; 3&#39; )
False
</pre>

This extends to deeper levels even. The values and the structure must be the same. Even if the ultimate scalar values are the same, they have show up in the structure in the same way:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, 2, (4,5) ) eqv ( 1, (2,4), 5 )
False
</pre>

And even to the object identity. And Array may hold the same values, but it is not the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, 2, (4,5) ) eqv ( 1, 2, [4,5] )
False
</pre>

Besides <code>eq</code> and <code>eqv</code>, Perl 6 has the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_==="><code>===</code></a> that tests for object identity. This was the start of my thinking on this post, but more about that in a moment. Even if the two lists have the same values and structure, they aren&#39;t the same object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; ( 1, 2, 3 ) === ( 1, 2, 3 )
False
</pre>

But, I might have the same object stored differently. This Array and Scalar are the same because they store the same object:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my @array = ( 1, 2, 3 )
[1 2 3]
&gt; my $scalar = @array
[1 2 3]
&gt; @array === $scalar
True
</pre>

A change in one shows up in the other, which is almost a non-sensical thing to say because there is no &quot;other&quot;. It&#39;s the same thing:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; $scalar[*-1] = &#39;Hamadryas&#39;
Hamadryas
&gt; @array
[1 2 Hamadryas]
</pre>

And here where this came up for me. I need the permutations of a list (which, as you know, if the <i>ordered</i> structure that allows the same value to show up multiple times). Consider permutations of <code>(1, 3, 3)</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations
((1 3 3) (1 3 3) (3 1 3) (3 3 1) (3 1 3) (3 3 1))
</pre>

I might not care that two permutations are <code>(1, 3, 3)</code> show up twice as long as I process one of them. Suppose I want the list of all the values of the sum of the first two items multiplied by the third:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.map: { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] }
(12 12 12 6 12 6)
</pre>

I&#39;ve done that operation six times, but if I only care about the unique values, I&#39;ve done a lot more work than I needed to do to get two value:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.map( { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] } ).unique
(12 6)
</pre>

In this example it&#39;s not a big deal, but imagine much larger lists and more complicated operations. Consider how that makes <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction">junctions</a> much larger:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; any( (1,3,3).permutations.map( { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] } ) ) &gt; 13
any(False, False, False, False, False, False)
</pre>

Curiously, this gives a Junction back instead of a Boolean, but I&#39;ve asked about that in the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1269">docs repo</a> and on <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131114">RT</a>.

So, I might try <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/List#routine_unique"><code>.unique</code></a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.unique
((1 3 3) (1 3 3) (3 1 3) (3 3 1) (3 1 3) (3 3 1))
</pre>

That didn&#39;t reduce the list, though. That method checks pairs of items with <code>===</code>. That&#39;s the check for object identity. The duplicated permutations look the same because they have the same values in the same order, but they are different objects.

No matter. I can tell <code>.unique</code> to compare elements any way that I like by using the <code>:with</code> adverb. If I use <code>eqv</code>, I end up with only the permutations I can distinguish:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; (1,3,3).permutations.unique( :with(&amp;[eqv]) )
((1 3 3) (3 1 3) (3 3 1))
</pre>

Now I process half the number of elements:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; any( (1,3,3).permutations.unique( :with(&amp;[eqv]) ).map( { ($_[0] + $_[1])*$_[2] } ) ) &gt; 13
any(False, False, False)
</pre>

There are many other <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_eqv">comparison operations</a>.  Some of them might not give you a &quot;wrong&quot; answer, but you might end up doing more processing than you need to do.

<i><b>UPDATE</b> - <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">Rakudo is now in Chocolatey</a> so most of this is really easy now.</i>

<a href="https://www.appveyor.com">AppVeyor</a> provides continuous testing on Windows. I wanted to try it with Perl 6 since I don&#39;t want to ignore Windows in <i>Learning Perl 6</i>. I found a some configuration examples, but none of them satisfied me. I spent a bit too much time messing around with PowerShell to produce <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test/blob/master/.appveyor.yml">my own AppVeyor configuration</a>. <!--more-->

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img height="682" src="/images/appveyor.png" width="500">
</div>
</div>

I had my own simple requirements:

<ul>
<li>I want to use the latest Rakudo Star, like most people will for everyday work
</li><li>I want the build to be fast. 
	<ul>
	<li>Don&#39;t build Rakudo every time
	</li><li>Cache whatever I can
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>

Along the way I ran into several inadequacies in PowerShell and various other Microsoft tools. These things provide a challenge to the non-interactive programmer.

But, I have something that works. The first time around I install <a href="https://www.strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> and <a href="">Rakudo Star</a>. If everything in the build goes well, AppVeyor caches these installations so I don&#39;t need to do them again. I&#39;ve also setup the config with a kludey way to invalidate that cache (which <a href="http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/questions/1310-delete-cache">AppVeyor still declines to provide as a button on the website</a>). 

I install <a href="https://www.strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> to get <a href="http://perltricks.com/article/177/2015/6/9/Get-to-grips-with-Prove--Perl-s-test-workhorse/">prove</a>. That&#39;s easy because it has a <a href="http://perltricks.com/article/177/2015/6/9/Get-to-grips-with-Prove--Perl-s-test-workhorse/">chocolately</a> package that AppVeyor can figure out on its own. 

Rakudo is a bit tougher. There&#39;s an old chocolately package (I&#39;m figuring out how to fix that). I download the latest Rakudo, but I wasting a lot of time wondering if the installer was doing anything. That installer works in the background in another process, so <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/heaths/2005/11/15/waiting-for-msiexec-exe-to-finish/">Powershell doesn&#39;t know how to wait for it to finish</a>. All of that research made me miss Perl (of either flavor) where it&#39;s easy to get answers to even difficult questions. Many communities can&#39;t get answers to simple questions. But, that&#39;s life.

After that, everything is easy and looks like the basic continuous integration testing.

I&#39;m done working on it until I have another problem, but there are <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test/issues">some other things I&#39;d like my config to do</a>:

<ul>
<li>Report code coverage
</li><li>Send reports to some sort of CPAN Testers thing
</li><li>Allow people to build against different versions of Rakudo (&quot;hey, it worked last month!&quot;)
</li></ul>

[mathjax]

Perl 6 has some amazing numerical features, including builtin <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Complex">complex number</a> computations. You might never need these, but they permit a bit of math geekry that I find quite pleasing. That pleasure is especially strong in Euler&#39;s Formula: <!--more-->

$$
e^{i\pi} = -1
$$

It&#39;s even more pleasing when I move everything to one side (and this will become important to Perl 6 later):

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

This tiny formula has everything you need to know about everything (almost). There&#39;s the natural base, the imaginary unit, the ratio of a circle&#39;s circumference to its diameter, and the multiplicative and additive identities. Curiously how all of that works out.

When I try this in the Perl 6 REPL I almost got the right answer, but not quite:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
&gt; e**(i*pi)
-1+1.22464679914735e-16i
&gt; e**(i*pi) == -1
False
</pre>

That&#39;s right. I <i>almost</i> get the right answer. Most of you are probably used to these minor imprecisions and the practical programming considerations that come with them.

That&#39;s not a problem because Perl 6 anticipates these situations with the <code>=~=</code>, or the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_=~=">approximately-equal operator</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; e**(i*pi) =~= -1
True
</pre>

So, close enough is good enough for horseshoes, hand grenades, and now Perl 6.

I can also use <code>≅</code> (U+2245, ᴀᴘᴘʀᴏxɪᴍᴀᴛᴇʟʏ ᴇqᴜᴀʟ ᴛᴏ) version of the operator:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; e**(i*pi) ≅ -1
True
</pre>

The <code>$*TOLERANCE</code> variable controls how almost &quot;almost&quot; is. By default it&#39;s 1e-15. That&#39;s really small but its still larger than the <code>1.22464679914735e-16i</code> extra bit I saw.

I need to be careful though. The <code>=~=</code> looks at the <i>relative</i> difference instead of the <i>absolute</i> difference. Here&#39;s something you might not expect to be approximately equal since the values differ by 1 (which you think is much larger than 1e-15):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 9999999999999999 =~= 9999999999999998
True
</pre>

It&#39;s their relative difference that matters though. That&#39;s the absolute value of their difference divided by the least absolute value of the two:

$$
\frac{| x - y |}{ min( |x|, |y| ) }
$$

Turn that into Perl 6 (I really like that infix <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_min"><code>min</code></a> operator):

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; sub relative-difference ( $x, $y ) { abs( $x - $y ) / ( abs($x) min abs($y) ) }
&gt; relative-difference( 999999999999999, 999999999999998 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
1.000000e-15
&gt; relative-difference( 999999999999999, 999999999999997 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
2.000000e-15
</pre>

This works because very small differences in the large numbers might be less significant as very small differences in small numbers?

Huh?

It sounds like double talk, but this takes into account the size of the numbers when looking at the tolerance. Consider the case at the small end. Any value smaller than 1e-15 is within 1e-15 of 1e-15, but that isn&#39;t very helpful. The relative difference takes the sizes of the values into account. Thus, this is false because the relative difference is almost an order of magnitude:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 1e-15 =~= 1e-16
False
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-16 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.000000e+00
</pre>

This way, the tolerance value doesn&#39;t overwhelm the comparison as you get close to the tolerance itself.

That&#39;s not the end of the story, though. Why is this one different? These are the same values with one moved over to the other side of the comparison:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 1e-15 - 1e-16 =~= 0
True
</pre>

There&#39;s a problem with relative difference. As the smaller value gets much closer to zero, the relative difference goes to infinity:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-17 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.900000e+01
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-18 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.990000e+02
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-19 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.999000e+03
&gt; relative-difference( 1e-15, 1e-21 ).fmt(&#39;%e&#39;)
9.999990e+05
</pre>

The absolute difference in all of those are less than 1e-15, but the relative difference are very high. So, when one side of my comparison is exactly 0, the <code>=~=</code> switches to the absolute difference. That&#39;s why <code>1e-15 - 1e-16 =~= 0</code> is <code>True</code>.

This means you can get different answers depending on the structure of the comparison:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; 9999999999999999 - 9999999999999998 =~= 0 # absolute
False
&gt; 9999999999999999 =~= 9999999999999998     # relative
True
</pre>

If I check that the difference is close to zero, I compare the absolute difference. If I compare two non-zero values to each other, I compare their relative difference.

Although it doesn&#39;t matter in this case, that&#39;s one of the pleasures of moving the 1 to the right:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; e**(i*pi) + 1 =~= 0
True
</pre>

And, here&#39;s one final tidbit. You can change the tolerance. If you want two and two to be five, select the right tolerance level:

<pre class="brush:plain">
&gt; my $*TOLERANCE = 0.21; 2 + 2 =~= 5      # relative
True
&gt; my $*TOLERANCE = 0.21; 2 + 2 - 5 =~= 0  # absolute
False
&gt; my $*TOLERANCE = 1.1; 2 + 2 - 5 =~= 0   # absolute
True
</pre>

Now I want the string version of this.

I went looking for some sort of official test corpus to throw at parsers. Googling gave me some internal links to json.org for a tool called <a href="http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/">JSON_Checker</a> that has some test files.  As I created my own JSON grammar (which looks just like all the examples I list at the end of this post, really), I used JSON_Checker files as the tests. I fixed some tests and put my versions in it my <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/json-acceptance-tests">json-acceptance-tests GitHub repo</a>.

<pre class="brush:plain">
use Terminal::ANSIColor;

# https://github.com/briandfoy/json-acceptance-tests
my $pass_fail_directory = @*ARGS[0]; # wherever you put them
my @files = dir( $pass_fail_directory, test =&gt; rx/ &#39;.json&#39; $ / );

# two grammars I created, which aren&#39;t important here.
my @grammars = &lt;Grammar::JSON Grammar::RFC7159&gt;;

for @grammars -&gt; $grammar {
	put &quot;Trying grammar $grammar&quot;;
	require ::($grammar);

Here&#39;s the output, which I&#39;ve labeled nicely with <a href="https://github.com/tadzik/Terminal-ANSIColor">Terminal::ANSIColor</a>. Those failures aren&#39;t real. One doesn&#39;t believe that anything other than an object or array can be a top-level value and the other thinks you should stop parsing at a certain depth.

I&#39;ve had my head down working on the &quot;Grammars&quot; chapter, and along
the way I&#39;ve been using <code>dd</code> to look at things. It&#39;s better than nothing, but it&#39;s also very compact and unwrapped. I really wanted a pretty printer, and I was even prepared to write my own. But, I don&#39;t have to. Here are three modules that can do it for you. <!--more-->

But Jeff Goff has already written <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp">Pretty::Printer</a>. I wasn&#39;t able to install it with panda or zef (and it&#39;s not listed on <a href="http://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a>). But, you can get it from the <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp">perl6-pp GitHub repo</a>.

Here&#39;s a structure that I want to inspect. It includes a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Match">Match</a> object with a named capture:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;
use lib qw/lib/;

my $match = (&#39;123456789&#39; ~~ m:g/$&lt;digit&gt;=(\d+:)/);

my %hash =
	dog =&gt; &#39;Nikki&#39;,
	cat =&gt; &#39;Buster&#39;,
	butterfly =&gt; &#39;Hamadryas&#39;,
	array =&gt; [ 5 .. 10 ],
	complex =&gt; {
		one =&gt; 37,
		two =&gt; &quot;Buster&quot;,
		three =&gt; [ 3..7 ],
		four =&gt; {
			array =&gt; [ 4..7 ],
			hash  =&gt; {
				dog =&gt; &#39;Newfie&#39;,
				}
			},
		},
	match =&gt; $match;
	;
</pre>

I can use the built-in <code>dd</code> to get this very compact representation that just needs whitespace in the right places:

<pre class="brush:plain">
Hash %hash = {:array($[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]), :butterfly(&quot;Hamadryas&quot;), :cat(&quot;Buster&quot;), :complex(${:four(${:array($[4, 5, 6, 7]), :hash(${:dog(&quot;Newfie&quot;)})}), :one(37), :three($[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), :two(&quot;Buster&quot;)}), :dog(&quot;Nikki&quot;), :match($(Match.new(ast =&gt; Any, list =&gt; (), hash =&gt; Map.new((:digit(Match.new(ast =&gt; Any, list =&gt; (), hash =&gt; Map.new(()), orig =&gt; &quot;123456789&quot;, to =&gt; 9, from =&gt; 0)))), orig =&gt; &quot;123456789&quot;, to =&gt; 9, from =&gt; 0),))}
</pre>

With <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp/pull/2">Pretty::Printer</a> (using the <a href="https://github.com/drforr/perl6-pp/pull/2">pull request I just sent</a>), I can choose some formatting options:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use Pretty::Printer;

my $pp = Pretty::Printer.new(
	pre-item-spacing       =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,
	post-item-spacing      =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,

	intra-group-spacing    =&gt; &quot;&quot;,

	pre-separator-spacing  =&gt; &#39;&#39;,
	post-separator-spacing =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;,

	indent-style           =&gt; &quot;   &quot;,
	);

say $pp.pp( %hash );
</pre>

The output is a bit rough, but it&#39;s much easier for me to read, especially with the match stuff:

<pre class="brush:plain">
${
   :array($[
      5,
      6,
      7,
      8,
      9,
      10
   ]),
   :butterfly(&quot;Hamadryas&quot;),
   :cat(&quot;Buster&quot;),
   :complex(${
      :four(${
         :array($[
            4,
            5,
            6,
            7
         ]),
         :hash(${
            :dog(&quot;Newfie&quot;)
         })
      }),
      :one(37),
      :three($[
         3,
         4,
         5,
         6,
         7
      ]),
      :two(&quot;Buster&quot;)
   }),
   :dog(&quot;Nikki&quot;),
   :match($(
         Match.new(${
                    :ast(Any),
                    :from(0),
                    :hash(Map.new(
                       :digit(Match.new(${
                              :ast(Any),
                              :from(0),
                              :hash(Map.new()),
                              :list($()),
                              :orig(&quot;123456789&quot;),
                              :to(9)
                       })))),
                    :list($()),
                    :orig(&quot;123456789&quot;),
                    :to(9)
         })
   ))
}
</pre>

There&#39;s also <a href="https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-data-dump">Data::Dump</a> (which you can install with <i>panda</i>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
use Data::Dump;
say Dump %hash;
</pre>

I find the output is a bit too detailed for most of my needs, but does fine with the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Match">Match</a> object. Although you can&#39;t see it here, the output can be colored if your terminal supports that:

<pre class="brush:plain">

It might be more comfortable for people used to the Microsoft hierarchical interfaces, but notice how it&#39;s not that interesting for <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Match">Match</a> objects:
