I changed my Perl 6 Travis setup so I'm not using the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/community-supported-languages/">community supported</a> Perl 6. That one builds rakudo and sometimes it exhausts the memory. Even if it didn't do that it takes awhile to get to the things I want to test. My new configuration takes the run time from about 7 to under 2 minutes. <!--more-->

<A href="https://github.com/nxadm">Claudio Ramirez</a> provides some <A href="https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg">pre-built Rakudo packages for Linux</a>. I can install those instead of building Rakudo. To do that I can't declare a language (or can declare some language that in the base image). Declaring  "perl6" builds rakudo—maybe someone will change the community edition to use the pre-built package.

I still have a problem with the URL to get the pre-built package. There is a URL to get the latest package by <A href="https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/lib.js">redirecting through some javascript</a>. It's not something that needs to happen in Javascript since the answers don't change and we could have a static page. That's maybe something I can work on later—or maybe you can. Put the direct links in the README and regenerate that when the packages change (monthly).

This is working nicely so far and I can improve on it later:
