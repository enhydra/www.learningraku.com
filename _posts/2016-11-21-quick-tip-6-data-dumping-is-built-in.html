I've often wished that Perl 5's <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/Data::Dumper">Data::Dumper</a> was built into the language. I often have statements like: <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!perl5
Dumper( @array ); use Data::Dumper;
</pre>

Or, if I'm playing with <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/Mojolicious">Mojolicious</a>:

<pre class="brush:perl">
#!perl5
use Mojo::Util qw(dumper);
dumper( @array );
</pre>

Rakudo (one of the Perl 6 implementations) has this baked in as <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/dd">dd</a>. This is something extra beyond the Perl 6 specification. Here I drop into the REPL:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
> my @array = 'a' .. 'g'
[a b c d e f g]
> dd @array
Array @array = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]
</pre>

There is also the gist and perl methods. The first gives you output designed for people and the second shows the actual Perl interpretation:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> @array.gist
[a b c d e f g]
> @array.perl
["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]
</pre>

If that's not enough for you, there's the <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/">Data::Dump</a> module that can do many other things, including colorizing the output.
