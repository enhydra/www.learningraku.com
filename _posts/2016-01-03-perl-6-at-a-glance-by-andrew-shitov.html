Andrew Shitov's <i><a href="http://deeptext.media/perl6-at-a-glance/">Perl 6 at a Glance</a></i> is already shipping out books. I haven't had a chance to read it myself, but from the excerpts on the website this looks like a nice survey of the Perl 6 language. It's not a tutorial book like <i>Learning Perl 6</i>, but I think it's more than enough to whet your appetite for some of the cool features.

If you are daunted by the reams of pages the printed docs would be, this 130-page book may give you what you need to know with a lot less work.
