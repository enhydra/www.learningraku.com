I started a GitHub project to <A href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl5faq_in_perl6">translate the Perl 5 perlfaq to Perl 6</a>. For years I maintained those documents so they are a bit special to me. Sadly, the <A href="https://github.com/tpf/perlfaq">canonical TPF repo</a> started over in 2012 with the sources current in v5.15, so most of that history has been lost. Oh well. <!--more-->

I don't want to create a new FAQ for Perl 6, because an <A href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq.html">official FAQ</a> already exists. If that document steals from this new project, that's fine with me. I'm doing this just because I am, and if you want to help or play with it, welcome! But, I'm just translating and adapting, not adding or deleting.

I grabbed the perlfaq questions and put them into new documents, created a repo, and filled in some of the basic meta-answers for perlfaq1. I'm curious how the rest of the perlfaq would turn out. The questions were things important to people twenty years ago. How does that hold up today?

<ul>
<li>Some things might not matter anymore in Perl 6
<li>Some things use different tools now
<li>The modules have all changed, and if they haven't, we can <a href="/2016/12/07/quick-tip-22-use-perl-5-modules-in-perl-6/">use the Perl 5 modules</a>.
</ul>

If it doesn't matter anymore, keeping the question but explaining the way Perl 6 handles it for you is something some people will appreciate. If it's a task-based question, people probably still have the question (and will have it frequently).
