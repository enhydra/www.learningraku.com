If you only want my Perl 6 messages, I've created a new <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningPerl6">@LearningPerl6</a> Twitter account. Like my other <a href="https://twitter.com/briandfoy_perl">@briandfoy_perl</a> is mostly just Perl with some things that Perl people might like, this one will be even more restricted. If you like feeds, this blog can do that. You'll get the same articles on Twitter (through <a href="https://dlvrit.com">dlvr.it</a>), as well as other interesting things I might run across. <!--more-->

And, if there's another social media spot you'd like to get notices, let me know about those. I'll see what I can do.
