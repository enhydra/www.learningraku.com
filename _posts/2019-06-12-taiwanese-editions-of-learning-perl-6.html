Learning Perl 6 has its first translation. I know that the translators worked hard on it because I answered many questions for them. It is on sale now at <a href="https://www.kingstone.com.tw/new/basic/2014713579683">KingStone</a> and <a href="https://www.tenlong.com.tw/products/9789865021382">Ten Long</a> and probably other places.
