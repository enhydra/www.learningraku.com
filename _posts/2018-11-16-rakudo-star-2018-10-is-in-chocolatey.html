Rakudo Star 2018.10 is now in Chocolatey as the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/rakudostar">rakudostar</a> package. There's something to note here: Steve Mynott has he's not going to prepare another Rakudo Star release. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be more releasesâ€”just that someone else needs to prepare them.

You might have expected this since the Rakudo Star releases have been gradually missing their release months and that the last two were backdated. That's not a big deal, but it shows that it's not trivial to put out these releases. The Rakudo compiler has monthly releases.

Maybe you can be the person who makes this easier!
