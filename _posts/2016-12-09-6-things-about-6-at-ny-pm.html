I gave a short talk to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/The-New-York-Perl-Meetup-Group/">New York Perl mongers</a> about six things I like at Perl 6. I wouldn't label these as the most groundbreaking, novel, or exciting features. They are just six things I picked out from what I was thinking about this week. Sometimes it's the little touches that matter. <!--more-->

If you'd like me to give a presentation to your group, let me know (brian.d.foy@gmail.com). I'd like to do a bunch more of these talks to get a feel for the Perl 6 audience and how I can incorporate that into the book.
