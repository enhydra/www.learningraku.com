AppVeyor now <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/getting-started-with-appveyor-for-linux/">supports Ubuntu</a> along with Windows. I've updated my <A href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test">Perl 6 AppVeyor config example</a> to include that. I created a <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">chocolatey package for Rakudo Star</a> to make it easier to test on AppVeyor. I think there are some Rakudo Star packages for linux in the future and that will make the linux side even easier and faster. At the moment it takes about 20 minutes to build before you get to the tests.
