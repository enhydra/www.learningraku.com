This is a really <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/category/kickstarter-tips/">Quick Tip</a>. It's about the Schwartzian Transform, which makes things quicker. <!--more-->

You may have seen my presentation from the <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/alpineperl2016/">Alpine Perl Workshop 2016</a>. I talked abou the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brian_d_foy/the-surprisingly-tense-history-of-the-schwartzian-transform">surprisingly tense history of the Schwartzian Transform</a>. I also <A href="http://perltricks.com/article/the-history-of-the-schwartzian-transform/">wrote about it for PerlTricks</a>.

In short, Randal didn't invent it but he made it popular. The popularity wasn't immediate though.

In Perl 5 that looks like this map-sort-map:

<pre class="brush:plain">
print
  map { $_->[0] }
  sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] }
  map { [$_, lc] }
  &lt;>;
</pre>

The trick is to reduce the number of time you call <code>lc</code>. There's no need to call it over and over on the same string.

How would you do the same thing in Perl 6?

First, Perl 6 has a unary version of <code><a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/sort#(Any)_method_sort">sort</a></code>. I tell it how to make a value then it does that for each pair of elements to compare:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my @sorted_words = sort { .lc }, @words;
</pre>

It takes two elements from the list, lowercases both of them, and compares them with string equality (cmp). You don't have to type out the <code>.lc</code> twice. This doesn't transform the elements, so the output list isn't necessarily all lowercase. It's the original list but possibly re-ordered.

Not only that, sort caches the result of the operation so it doesn't have to redo it. That is, Perl 6 already does what the Schwartzian Transform was doing!
