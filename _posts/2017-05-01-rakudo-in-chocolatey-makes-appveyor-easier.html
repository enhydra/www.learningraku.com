Rakudo is now easier to install on Windows. <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/rakudostar">Rakudo Star is now in Chocolatey</a> (with 2017.04 awaiting moderation as I write this). This makes it much easier to automatically deploy Rakudo Star in Windows environments.

Earlier this month I spent too much time getting <A href="/2017/04/02/rakudo-star-on-appveyor/">Rakudo to install on AppVeyor</a>, and, having spent too much time on that, I spent a bunch more getting co-maintainer permissions on the chocolatey package. I updated the original package created by Jake Russo back in 2015, including all the new chocolatey requirements. I have all of that in GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/rakudo-star-chocolatey">rakudo-star-chocolatey</a>. After the semi-manual approval process, I have a fresh Rakudo available. Two days later 2017.04 came out. I've updated the package again and it's in moderation (should clear in a couple days).

Using a package manager that other services already support makes it a cinch to deploy Rakudo there. For example, Windows 10 has <a href="https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/blob/master/readme.md">OneGet</a>, a manager of package managers. You can install several package manager and ask OneGet to install something. Somehow it figures out who can provide it and does the magic:

<div class="image center">
<div>
<img src="/images/oneget-powershell.png" height="369" width="500" style="border:1" />
</div>
</div>

That looks complicated, but it's really two commands with some confirmations:

<pre class="brush:plain">
PS C:\> Get-PackageProvider -name chocolatey

PS C:\> Install-Package rakudostar
</pre>

You probably have to answer a couple of questions in this process. The rakudostar package isn't trusted, but the chocolatey package has the SHA256 of the MSI from <a href="http://rakudo.org/">rakudo.org</a>. But, chocolatey also trusts me to use the right URL. I could put anything in there. I'll have to work on the trusted part some other time (unless you want to figure it out).

Now my AppVeyor config in the <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test"> perl6_appveyor_test</a> test project is now much simpler. The Rakudo installation is a couple of lines instead of the tricky PowerShell I had before:

<pre class="plain">
  - if not exist "C:\Rakudo" cinst rakudostar
  - SET PATH=C:\rakudo\bin;C:\rakudo\share\perl6\site\bin;%PATH%
  - ps: refreshenv
  - perl6 -v
</pre>
