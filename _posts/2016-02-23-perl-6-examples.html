In the early days of Perl 6 we don't have a library of reliable books, mostly because the language had shifted so rapidly. But, there are plenty of examples of Perl 6. I've listed some of them in the sidebar of <a href="/">this website</a>. <!--more-->

<ul>
<li>The <a href="//github.com/perl6/roast">test suite ("roast")</a> for Perl 6 has examples of almost all of the features so developers can verify the specification.
<li><a href="//rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Perl_6">Rosetta Code has a section with Perl 6 examples</A>.
<li><a href="//examples.perl6.org/">There's examples.perl6.org</a>, which includes <A href="//examples.perl6.org/categories/euler.html">Project Euler solutions</a>. See it's <a href="https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples">GitHub repo</a> too.
<li><a href="//learnxinyminutes.com/docs/perl6/">Learn Perl 6 in Y minutes</a> is a summary of Perl 6, in code.
</ul>

We don't emphasize code reading enough. We're used to teaching you how to write new code, usually while you struggle with a particular concept we give you. You'll learn much more by reading code. Someone else will do it slightly differently or even in a completely different way using features you didn't know about.
