I'm working on <a href="https://www.learningperl6.org">Learning Perl 6</a> and I spend a lot of my time going between repos to suss out various things. Etsy's <A href="https://github.com/etsy/hound">Hound</a> is a tool that makes that easier, and I've made a <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-hound">GitHub project with my setup</a>.

<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.perl6.org">Perl 6</a> development is spread over several repositories. That's a consequence that there's no <i>a priori</i> preferred implementation, and that's on purpose.

Anything that passes the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/roast">roast tests</a> is Perl 6. That has its own repo. <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">Rakudo</a> is one such implementation. It has its own repo.

But, Perl 6 is largely written in Perl 6. There's a smaller version of the language, <a href="https://github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP</a> for <b>N</b>ot <b>Q</b>uite <b>P</b>erl6, that targets the virtual machines. A smaller feature set makes it easier to implement new virtual targets and that should encourage more backends. NQP has its own repo.

And the <A href="https://github.com/perl6/doc">docs</a> have their own directory too.

That means it's not quite as simple as grepping (acking, whatever) a repository. These are separate projects that I'd have to keep separately updated.

Etsy released a tool they call <a href="https://github.com/etsy/hound">hound</a>, written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>. They have instructions, but here's a summary:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Install Go 1.3+</a>. I used a binary package.
<li>Run <code>go get github.com/etsy/hound/cmds/...</code>
<li>Create a directory for <i>houndd</i> to do its work
<li>Create your <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-hound/blob/master/config.json">config.json</a> to list the repos in that directory
<li>Run <code>$GOPATH/bin/houndd</code> in that directory
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:6080">http://localhost:6080</a>
</ul>

I've also built most of this into the <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-hound/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a>. Use the *run* target to get it going:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ make run
</pre>
