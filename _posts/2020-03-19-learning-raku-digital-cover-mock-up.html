<p>
<i>Learning Perl 6</i> won't be renamed <i>Learning Raku</i> until at soonest the next major release cycle (maybe in a couple of years), although the latest cover for the reprint says "Covers Raku" in the upper right banner. However, if you have a digital version, you might like to replace your digital cover with this one I mocked up and is completely unofficial and unauthorized (<a href="/images/cover-large-raku.png">PNG</a>, <a href="/images/cover-large-raku.pdf">PDF</a>):
