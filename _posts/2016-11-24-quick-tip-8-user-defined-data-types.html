Perl 6 has <a href="http://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/">"gradual typing"</a>. I can constrain values when I like, and let them run free otherwise. User-defined data types are one of the Perl 6 features that excite me the most. I can define what sort of value I can put in a container thingy, and I can define my own types any way that I like. <!--more-->

First, I'll show a couple of built-in types. I can constrain an array to contain only <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Int">Int</a> values. I place the type between the declarator and the variable name. If every value I want to store is that type, I have no problem. If there's a non-decimal integer string (say, a hex digit), I have a problem:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6
To exit type 'exit' or '^D'
> my Int @array = < 1 2 3 >
[1 2 3]
> my Int @other_array = < 8 9 a b >
Type check failed in assignment to @other_array; expected Int but got Str ("a")
</pre>

This means I can constrain some thing at the point I store them in the variable instead of checking a type-agnostic array every time I use it somewhere else.

Perl 6 already comes with some classes. The <code>Int</code> type is a platform-agnostic number that doesn't depend on the local ideas of integers. I could use the lowercase version, <code>int</code>, to specify a native type. Those are limited to the storage types on the platform:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> my Int $j = 99999999999999999999
99999999999999999999
> my int $j = 99999999999999999999
Cannot unbox 67 bit wide bigint into native integer
</pre>

I can make my own type. I can create my own classes and then use those class names as types:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> class Butterfly {}
(Butterfly)
> my Butterfly $thingy1 = Butterfly.new
Butterfly.new
> my $animal = Butterfly.new
Butterfly.new
> $animal.WHAT
(Butterfly)
> my Butterfly $thingy2 = $animal
Butterfly.new
> my Butterfly $thingy3 = 137
Type check failed in assignment to $thingy3; expected Butterfly but got Int (137)
</pre>

Check that out! I didn't put anything in the class, but Perl 6 provided the <code>new</code> constructor for me. I'll write about that some other time.

I can create subtypes based on those that already exist. First, the
value has to satisfy the base type, then the extra constraint I put on it. I use subset to start it off and a where clause with some code:

<pre class="brush:plain">
> subset Vowel of Str where *.lc âˆˆ set( &lt;a e i o u y m> )
(Vowel)
> my Vowel $s = 'A';
A
> my Vowel $s = 'e'
e
> my Vowel $s = 'j'
Type check failed in assignment to $s; expected Vowel but got Str ("j")
</pre>

In this case, I created a new type called <code>Vowel</code> based on <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str.html">Str</a>. The value has to be some sort of string, so thats a start, but I constrain it to be a string in a set (which I wrote about yesterday in <a href="/2016/11/23/quick-tip-8-perl-6-sets/">Perl 6 sets</a>).

Zoffix has a very good post, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2016/04/perl-6-types-made-for-humans.html">"Perl 6 Types: Made for Humans"</A> on the same thing, and Brad Clawsie created <A href="https://github.com/bradclawsie/Subsets-Common">Subsets::Common</a> to comprise interesting types. A  <a href="http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/222555/103630">StackExchange question on gradual typing</a> is very interesting as well, although it has virtually nothing to do with Perl 6. Jonathan
Worthington has an <a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-yapc-eu-perl6types.pdf">older presentation on types</a> from YAPC::EU 2008.
