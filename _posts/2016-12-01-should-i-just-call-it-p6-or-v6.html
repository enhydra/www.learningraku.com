I'm working on chapter that I need to turn in to O'Reilly and I keep typing "Perl 6". It's annoying. But, what else would I call it? I'm not looking to change the name, just the nickname in the book. <!--more-->

I'm not annoyed because a previous language shares the name. No matter what I think that's a done deal. I'm more annoyed that it takes some much typing and is repetitive. In <A href="//www.learning-perl.com/">Learning Perl</a>, I often said things like "v5.24 does this" of "v5.10 did that" without saying the magic word. What if I said "v6"? For instance, the sentence, "In v6, the match operator immediately applies the pattern to $_." 

But, I think that also implies that it's a change from earlier versions. What about "P6"? It's the same thing. I could say "QP" for "Quite Perl 6" ;)

I'm talking about the language, not the implementation, so saying "Rakudo", "Rakudo Star", "R*" or the like aren't right.

And, when are we going to get an implementation named Camelia? ;)
