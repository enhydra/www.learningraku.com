You can uninstall Perl 6 modules. Many people have asked for a way to uninstall a Perl 5 module, but that toolchain didn't do the sort of tracking that Perl 6 does. Some of these are recent developments, so you should have the most recent <a href="http://www.rakudo.org">Rakudo</a> that you can use. <!--more-->

In <a href="https://github.com/ugexe/zef">zef</a>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ zef uninstall Some::Module
</pre>

If that doesn't work, niner has <A href="https://gist.github.com/niner/b39258032f70c083e57b">a gist that reaches into the internals</A>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
#!/usr/bin/env perl6
use v6.c;

sub MAIN($short-name, :$ver = True, :$auth = True, :$api = True) {
    my $comp-unit = $*REPO.resolve(CompUnit::DependencySpecification.new(:$short-name, :$ver, :$auth, :$api));
    $comp-unit.repo.uninstall($comp-unit.distribution);
}
</pre>
