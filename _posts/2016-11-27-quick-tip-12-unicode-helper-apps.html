Perl 6 uses fancy Unicode characters to do some of its work, but those don't show up on most keyboards. I like the Mac program <a href="https://earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/">UnicodeChecker</a>. I can search by name, code point, or I can paste a character. I find the one that I want, copy it, and paste it into source. The Windows program <a href="http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html">BabelStine</A> looks similar. Leave me suggestions if you know something for your distro. <!--more-->

Or, you can write your own program. Here's one that takes codepoints and prints their characters (assuming that your terminal is already set up for UTF-8):

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ perl6 -e 'for @*ARGS { say chr(:16($_)) }' 2150 2153
⅐
⅓
</pre>

The <code>:16()</code> interprets its string argument as base 16. You can convert any base between 2 and 36 that way. 

I can have some command-line aliases:

<pre class="brush:plain">
alias u2char='perl6 -e "for @*ARGS { say chr(:16(\$_)) }"'
</pre>
