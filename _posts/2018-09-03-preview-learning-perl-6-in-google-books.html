<p>
Most O'Reilly books have extensive previews on Google Books, and that's true for the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sbRqDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&ots=yy9KUe-W4Y&dq=learning%20perl%206%3A%20keeping%20the%20easy%2C%20hard%2C%20and%20impossible%20within%20reach%20brian%20d.%20foy&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=learning%20perl%206:%20keeping%20the%20easy,%20hard,%20and%20impossible%20within%20reach%20brian%20d.%20foy&f=false">Learning Perl 6 preview</a> too. You can check out the beginning of the book. If you like it you can buy the rest. Unfortunately the exercise answers are at the end of the book and not shown in the repo.

<p>
The formatting in Google Books is odd and does not look like the print sources (and we have to suffer through whatever e-readers try to do).
