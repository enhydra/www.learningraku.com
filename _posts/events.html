We don't have anything planned yet, but our plan is to run workshops and trainings to try out our material. The best way to get it right on paper is to get it right in person.

If you're an event organizer and you'd like to run a Perl 6 workshop or class, get in touch. We're happy to go anywhere that will at least cover our expenses. We can help you raise the funds for that.

If you'd like to have private, on-site training (perhaps as an add-on to regular Perl 5 training), get in touch with us through <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a>.
