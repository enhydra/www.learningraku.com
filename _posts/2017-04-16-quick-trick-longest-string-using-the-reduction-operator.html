I had a problem where I wanted the longest string from a list. I didn't want to sort because I wanted to do it with a single pass. (The comments show sorting through <code>max</code>, which I was also avoiding). <!--more-->

<pre class="brush:plain">
# quote words, but with quote protection!
my @strings = qww/
	"This is a line"
	short
	"A very very long string maybe, certainly the longest"
	other
	not
	this
	a
	one
	or
	even
	1
	/;

# If you give one thing to sort, it does that to both things and
# compares with camp
my ($longest) = @strings.sort( *.chars ).[*-1];
</pre>

Instead, I decided to use the <A href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Reduction_Operators">reduction operator</a> with an operator that I make up (and limit to the lexical scope). The infix <code>longest</code> takes two strings and returns the longest. I let the reduction take care of the rest:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my sub infix:<longest> { $^a.chars > $^b.chars ?? $^a !! $^b }
my $longest = [longest] @strings;

say "Longest is ｢$longest｣";
</pre>

Some commenters point out that calling <code>.max</code> does the same thing. Looking in the <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/8bf67298c7bac51790e924efc125e4f8f7600013/src/core/Any-iterable-methods.pm">Rakudo source for max</code>, you see that it's single pass too:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $longest = @strings.max: *.chars;
say "Longest is ｢$longest｣";
</pre>
