I've been fooling around with <A href="/2018/03/15/use-pre-built-rakudo-packages-on-travis-ci/">pre-built Rakudo packages on Travis CI</a> so I figured that I should do the same on AppVeyor. Last night I had a <A href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/briandfoy/venturi/build/1.0.12/job/ahmktqs4ynu5u7x2">Ubuntu build that ran out of memory</a> before it could finish compiling Rakudo and it gave up. <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/getting-started-with-appveyor-for-linux/">AppVeyor is rolling out Linux support</a> and I suspect their initial machines are underpowered (especially the ones I get for freeâ€”completely reasonable) but I haven't investigated it. It's certainly easier than the Pugs installations which could take days although much of that was just GHC. <!--more-->

The Windows side is easy because I use the <a href="/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">rakudo-star chocolatey package</a>.

This configuration is mostly the same as <A href="/2018/03/15/use-pre-built-rakudo-packages-on-travis-ci/">what I am doing on Travis</A> but translated to a configuration that's handling Windows and Linux at the same time. Lines starting with <code>sh:</code> are run on Linux only; lines with no prefix are run on both systems.
