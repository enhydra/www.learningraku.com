In October 2019, <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tpf-response-raku-rename">Perl 6 changed its name to Raku</a>. I think it's a good move to let the language stand on its own two feet.
</p>
<p>
I've updated the older domains for this blog to permanently redirect to the new <i>www.learningraku.com</i>. I'd already changed the Twitter account to <i><a href="https://twitter.com/LearningRaku">@LearningRaku</a></i>. If you run into something that doesn't work, let me know.
</p>
<p>
I'm also exploring how I can change the name of the printed and e-books. Since the book is created by print-on-demand, that might not be too hard. It could take some time since I'd also take the chance to update the book for current Raku behavior.

<p>
Various parts of the Raku community will change their names, labels, and references in the coming weeks as people have time to deal with the huge effort. <A href="https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3046">You might even be able to help</a>.
