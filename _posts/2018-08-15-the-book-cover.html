The book production is in its final phases. Now that we know how big the book is (a literal measurement), we know how wide the spine is (<a href="https://www.programmingperl.org/2012/03/20-years-of-programming-perl/">note the physical comparisons I did for <i>Programming Perl</i></a>). The page size is already fixed. From there we create cover that wraps the paper. Here it is:

You can <a href="https://goo.gl/KHavUw">pre-order Learning Perl 6 on Amazon (US Link)</a>.
