Andrew Shitov has published <a href="https://deeptext.media/perl6-at-a-glance/">Perl 6 at a Glance</a>, a survey book for the new language. I haven't had a change to read it yet, but you can buy it now and read it yourself. Some people have already received their copy. Get yours and tell everyone else about it.
