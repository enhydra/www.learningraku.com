Some people like to think you can't have a universal set. I say otherwise. The difference is what you can do about it.

Perl 6 has the empty set, <code>∅</code> and nothing is a member of that set:

<pre class="brush:plain">
if $a ∈ ∅ { put 'Never executes!' } # always False
</pre>

This is easy to construct with a set of no elements:

<pre class="brush:plain">
if $a ∈ set() { put 'Never executes!' } # always False
</pre>

Perl 6 can construct sets from finite sequences but I wondered about infinite ones. The universal set, <code>𝕌</code>, contains everything (although that causes some problems the set theorists haven't figured out other than to say "Don't do that").

But if I can figure out set membership without enumerating the members of the set I can make it work:

<pre class="brush:plain">
            # Double struck letters
class 𝕌 {}; # Universal, U+1D54C but wordpress don't like that

multi infix:<∈> ( Any:_ $c, 𝕌:U $ --> Bool ) { True }

use Test;

ok any(1,2) ∈ 𝕌, '(Junction) is part of the universal set';
ok   Any    ∈ 𝕌, '(Any) is part of the universal set';
ok   37     ∈ 𝕌, 'Int:D is part of the universal set';
ok  '37'    ∈ 𝕌, 'Integer string is part of the universal set';
ok   𝕌      ∈ 𝕌, 'Universal set contains itself? Not so sure...';
ok   ∅      ∈ 𝕌, 'Universal set contains the empty set';

done-testing();
</pre>

The trick is to figure out how to represent a set difference with a universal set. I know what the complement of that set so I need to flip around the operators. I'm still working out some other things (see <A href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48819031/2766176">Where did my Perl 6 operator go after I defined a more specific multi?</a> for one hiccup) to make the set operators work, though.
