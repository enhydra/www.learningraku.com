<a href="http://www.theperlshop.com">The Perl Shop</a> sponsored me to present a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brian_d_foy/6-more-things-about-perl-6">Perl 6 talk</a> to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Boston-pm/">Boston Perl mongers</a> last night. I pulled out six thing that I didn't <a href="/2016/12/09/6-things-about-6-at-ny-pm/">talk about at the New York Perl mongers last month</a>. As before, these aren't really the big ideas or most exciting features. They are sometimes small corners that lead to other ideas.

I'm lining up some Perl mongers groups I want to visit this spring. If you'd like me to give a presentation to your group, let me know (brian.d.foy@gmail.com).
