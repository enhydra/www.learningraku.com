<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6/posts/2268162">The book is going to the printers</a> so I'll have the paper book rewards soon. It's been awhile since the Kickstarter backers responded to the survey to supply their shipping addressâ€”<a href="https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005126894-How-can-I-view-or-change-my-survey-responses-">log into Kickstarter to change that</a>. Or, you can send me a message through Kickstarter or email (<A href="mailto:brian.d.foy@gmail.com">brian.d.foy@gmail.com</a>).

If you're reward was an ebook, update your email address so I can send it to the right place. The people with the monthly draft rewards will find that in Dropbox or GitHub.
