<p>
You can run Perl 6 tests with <code><a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/App::prove">prove</a></code>. Forget for a moment that <code>prove</code> is a Perl 5 tool. It's just some tool that's magically on your system. It's a <a href="https://testanything.org">Test Anywhere Protocol</a> consumer so anything that outputs TAP is fine with it.
</p>
</span>

<p>
I can tell the tool which program to use when it executes the test files by specifying it with <code>--exec</code>:
</p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ prove --exec perl6 some_test_file.t6
</pre>

<p>
A <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/testing">P6 test file</a> looks much like the old <a href="http://www.metacpan.org/module/">Test::More</a> stuff that you already know. However, since we've started fresh, it's just <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/lib/Test.pm6">Test</a>:
</p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
use v6;

use Test;

subtest 'is' => {
	is( "4", 4, "How do the Str and Int do?" );
	is( &lt;4>, 4, "How do the IntStr and Int do?" );
	}

subtest 'isa' => {
	isa-ok( &lt;4>, IntStr );
	isa-ok( &lt;4>, Int );
	isa-ok( &lt;4>, Str );
	isa-ok( &lt;4>, Rat );  # !!!
	}

done-testing;
</pre>
