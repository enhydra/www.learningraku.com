You can now <a href="https://goo.gl/KHavUw">pre-order Learning Perl 6 (Amazon US link)</a>. You've been able to do that for awhile but I didn't want to say anything until I knew it was going to be a book. Since I turned in the book to O'Reilly yesterday and it entered production today, I'm pretty sure that's happening now.

One of the curious effects of the publishing world is that all pre-orders count as first week sales. That means that books have months to collect orders that count when they are actually fulfilled. Of course, this means that people game the system to bump their books up in the charts for a bit.

If you were a KickStarter backer you don't need to order the book. I'll collect your details when the books are available and I'll send them to you myself.
