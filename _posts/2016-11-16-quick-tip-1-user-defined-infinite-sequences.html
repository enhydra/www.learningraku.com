Every day of the <A href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">Learning Perl 6 Kickstarter campaign</a>, I'll present a <a href="/category/kickstarter-tips/">quick tip</a> about something I like in Perl 6. Let's start with sequences. <!--more-->

We have simple sequences, like one digit to another. Here's 0 to 9:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $tenner := 0 ... 9;
</pre>

Notice a few things here. I've used the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_:=">infix binding operator, <code>:=</code></a>. It doesn't assign a value, it makes the lefthand side the same as the righthand side.

The <code>...</code> is the <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_...">sequence operator</a>, which we can use to produce <i>lazy</i> lists.

Lazy lists, you say? What if I wanted not just 0 to 9, but 0 to whatever number I felt like for as long as I wanted to run the program. I don't know what that number might be, so I won't specify it. I'll just call it "whatever" with the <code>*</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my $infinite := 0 ... *;
</pre>

Perl 6 doesn't compute this sequence. It knows that it starts at zero and keeps going until it reaches the end. That <code>*</code> is literally a <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> object. When Perl 6 wants to know if it's at the end, <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever">Whatever</a> says no.

That could be a long, long list. But, the laziness takes care of that. Perl 6 doesn't evaluate the next item until it needs it. This loop will go on forever:

<pre class="brush:plain">
for $infinite -> $next {
	say $next;
	}
</pre>

Big deal. We've had infinite loops forever (does anyone know who made the first one?). We can do this with <code>loop</code>:

<pre class="brush:plain">
loop ( my $i = 0; ; $i++ ) {
	say $i;
	}
</pre>

But, a loop is just a loop. It sits there all by itself. However, we can pass around a sequence, we can store it. We can so many other things with it. We can put it in a hash and choose the one we need later:

<pre class="brush:plain">
my %hash;

%hash&lt;s> := 7 ... 10;
%hash&lt;t> := 0 ...  3;
%hash&lt;u> := 137 ...  *;

show( %hash{ time %% 2 ?? 't' !! 's' } );

sub show ( $s ) {
	.say for |$s;
	}
</pre>

Yep, we just stored an infinite number of values in a single hash value. I'll have more on this in the next entry.
